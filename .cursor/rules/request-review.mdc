# Feature Request Review & Update

**Purpose:** Review and update a feature request after the user has answered questions in the "Questions to Resolve" section.

## **Review Process**
1. **Read the feature request** from [requests.md](mdc:requests.md)
2. **Identify answered questions** in the "Questions to Resolve" section
3. **Assess impact** - How do answers affect technical approach, acceptance criteria, and dependencies?
4. **Validate feasibility** - Is the implementation plan clear and achievable?
5. **Check completeness** - Are acceptance criteria specific and measurable?

## **Validation Requirements**
**Before updating the feature request:**
- **Preserve existing information** - Don't remove valuable context or decisions
- **Check dependency impact** - Verify changes don't affect other features
- **Validate technical consistency** - Ensure updates align with system architecture
- **Confirm resource feasibility** - Check if requirements are achievable

## **Status Updates**
- **Planning Phase → Ready for Development**: When all critical questions are answered, technical approach is clear, and acceptance criteria are complete
- **Ready for Development → Planning Phase**: If answers reveal new questions or clarification is needed
- **Update sections** based on resolved questions and answers

## **When Issues Are Found**
**If validation reveals problems:**
- **Don't proceed** with updates that could cause issues
- **Document concerns** - List specific problems or conflicts
- **Request clarification** - Ask user to resolve conflicts or provide missing information
- **Suggest alternatives** - Propose safer approaches
- **Preserve current state** until issues are resolved

## **Output Format**
```
