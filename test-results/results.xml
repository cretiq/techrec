<![CDATA[🏗️ Starting Single Source of Truth architecture verification...
📝 Step 1: Authenticating as experienced developer...
✅ Authentication completed
📝 Step 2: Ensuring clean test environment...
✅ CV management page loaded
📝 Step 3: Setting up comprehensive API monitoring...
✅ API monitoring setup completed
📝 Step 4: Testing CV upload with architectural migration...
📤 No existing CV found - proceeding with upload test...
📁 Uploading CV from: /Users/filipmellqvist/CursorProjects/techrec/tests/fixtures/Filip_Mellqvist_CV.pdf
🚀 Starting upload process...
📞 Intercepted CV upload API call
✅ Upload API response captured
⏳ Waiting for CV processing to complete...
⏳ Standard elements not found, checking if data was processed...
📊 Proceeding with API response analysis (UI may be different than expected)
📝 Step 5: Verifying architectural compliance...

🏗️ === UPLOAD ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS ===
📊 Upload API Response Structure:
  Success: N/A
  Message: N/A
  Analysis ID: N/A
  Developer ID: N/A
  ✅ No CvAnalysis data in response: true
  ✅ Indicates proper profile sync: undefined
📝 Step 6: Verifying data flow from proper tables...
📞 Intercepted latest analysis API call
✅ Latest analysis API response captured
