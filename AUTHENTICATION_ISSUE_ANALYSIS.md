# Authentication Issue Analysis & Resolution

## Problem Summary
User reports that CVs uploaded by `filip_mellqvist@msn.com` are visible in the user CV management page but NOT visible in the admin gamification page when searching for that email.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Database Investigation Results
Through comprehensive database analysis, I discovered there are **two different developer accounts**:

1. **Account 1: `filip_mellqvist@msn.com`**
   - Developer ID: `6862a908a88e6b4ea64e2715`
   - CVs: **0**
   - Skills: **0** 
   - Experience entries: **0**
   - Created: 2025-06-30

2. **Account 2: `filipmellqvist255@gmail.com`**
   - Developer ID: `67f8cfaf15efbda6b596c7b7`
   - CVs: **1** (Filip_Mellqvist_CV.pdf)
   - Skills: **24**
   - Experience entries: **3**
   - Created: 2025-04-11

### Issue Explanation
The user is currently **logged in as `filip_mellqvist@msn.com`** but somehow expects to see CV data that actually belongs to `filipmellqvist255@gmail.com`. This suggests:

1. **Account Confusion**: The user may have accidentally created two accounts with different OAuth providers
2. **Wrong Account Login**: The user is logged into the wrong account and expecting to see data from the other account
3. **Session Inconsistency**: There might be a browser/session issue causing data to appear incorrectly

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Session Verification
I've created a debug page for the user to verify their current session:

**Visit: `http://localhost:3000/debug/session`**

This page will show:
- Current authenticated email and user ID
- Database lookup consistency
- CV data comparison between session ID and email
- Potential inconsistencies

### Step 2: Account Consolidation Options

#### Option A: Log into Correct Account
If the user wants to access the account with CV data:
1. **Sign out** of current session
2. **Sign in** using the `filipmellqvist255@gmail.com` account (likely Google OAuth)
3. Verify CV data appears in both user and admin interfaces

#### Option B: Data Migration (if needed)
If the user wants to consolidate accounts:
1. Identify which account should be the primary account
2. Migrate CV, skills, and experience data from one account to the other
3. Delete or disable the secondary account

### Step 3: Admin Interface Verification
Once logged into the correct account:
1. **User CV Management**: Should show CV data
2. **Admin Gamification**: Should show same CV data when searching by the correct email

## Immediate Action Required

**Please visit `http://localhost:3000/debug/session` while logged in to verify:**
1. Which email you're currently authenticated as
2. Whether session data is consistent
3. Which developer ID your session contains

This will confirm whether you need to:
- Switch to a different account, or
- Investigate a deeper session consistency issue

## Files Created for Debugging
1. `/app/api/debug/session/route.ts` - Debug API endpoint
2. `/app/debug/session/page.tsx` - Debug page for user verification
3. `/scripts/debug-session-mismatch.ts` - Database analysis script

## Next Steps
Based on the debug session results, we can:
1. **If wrong account**: Guide user to log into correct account
2. **If session inconsistency**: Fix the authentication flow
3. **If data consolidation needed**: Migrate data between accounts

The most likely resolution is that the user needs to log out and log back in using the `filipmellqvist255@gmail.com` account (Google OAuth) to access their CV data.
