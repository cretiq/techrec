## üí≠ Active Feature Requests

### Feature Request #4: Multiple RapidAPI Endpoint Selection

**Status:** Planning Phase
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** Allow developers to choose between different job freshness levels (7 days, 24 hours, or hourly) to get the most relevant results for their search needs and optimize API usage patterns.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to select how fresh I want my job search results to be (from the last 7 days, 24 hours, or past hour), so that I can find the newest opportunities when needed or search broader when exploring more options.

**Success Metrics:**

- Increased user engagement with time-sensitive job searches
- Better API credit efficiency through targeted endpoint usage
- Reduced search time for users looking for fresh opportunities
- Improved user satisfaction with result relevance

**Available API Endpoints (‚úÖ All Available):**

- **7 Days Endpoint** (`active-jb-7d`) - Jobs from last 7 days ‚úÖ **Currently Implemented**
- **24 Hours Endpoint** (`active-jb-24h`) - Jobs indexed in last 24 hours ‚ö†Ô∏è **API Available, Not Implemented**
- **Hourly Endpoint** (`active-jb-1h`) - Jobs from last hour (Ultra & Mega plans only) ‚ö†Ô∏è **API Available, Not Implemented**

**Key Benefits by Endpoint:**

- **7 Days**: Broadest selection, good for comprehensive searches
- **24 Hours**: Fresh opportunities, better for daily job hunting
- **Hourly**: Latest postings, optimal for premium users with urgent needs

**Technical Implementation Plan:**

1. **Backend Enhancement** - Make API endpoint dynamic based on user selection
2. **Parameter Addition** - Add `endpoint` or `time_range` parameter to search
3. **Frontend UI** - Add endpoint selector in search filters
4. **Plan Validation** - Check user's API plan for Hourly endpoint access
5. **Cache Strategy** - Separate caching by endpoint to avoid conflicts

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Add endpoint selection UI component in AdvancedFilters
- [ ] Implement dynamic endpoint URL construction in API route
- [ ] Add endpoint parameter to SearchParameters interface
- [ ] Validate Hourly endpoint access based on API plan
- [ ] Update cache keys to include endpoint selection
- [ ] Show endpoint-specific information in search results
- [ ] Add endpoint selection to search form state management
- [ ] Display appropriate warnings for endpoint limitations

**Technical Details from Documentation:**

- **7 Days**: `https://linkedin-job-search-api.p.rapidapi.com/active-jb-7d` (current)
- **24 Hours**: `https://linkedin-job-search-api.p.rapidapi.com/active-jb-24h` (estimated)
- **Hourly**: `https://linkedin-job-search-api.p.rapidapi.com/active-jb-1h` (estimated, Ultra & Mega plans)
- **Performance Note**: `description_filter` has timeout risks with 7-day endpoint, recommended for 24h/Hourly
- **Refresh Schedule**: Hourly refresh with 1-2 hour delay, 2-hour delay for Hourly endpoint

**Implementation Requirements:**

- [ ] **Backend Changes**:
  - Add `endpoint` parameter to SearchParameters interface
  - Update API route to construct dynamic endpoint URLs
  - Add endpoint validation (check plan for Hourly access)
  - Update cache keys to separate by endpoint
- [ ] **Frontend Changes**:
  - Add endpoint selector component (radio buttons or dropdown)
  - Update AdvancedFilters to include time range selection
  - Add endpoint selection to search form state
  - Display endpoint-specific warnings and info
- [ ] **Validation & UX**:
  - Show warning for Hourly endpoint if not on Ultra/Mega plan
  - Display endpoint info (job count estimates, freshness)
  - Add tooltips explaining each endpoint's benefits

**Questions to Resolve:**

- [ ] Should we default to 7-day for broader results or 24h for freshness?
- [ ] How do we handle plan validation for Hourly endpoint?
- [ ] Should we show estimated job counts per endpoint?
- [ ] Do we want to automatically suggest better endpoints based on search criteria?
- [ ] Should endpoint selection be prominent or in advanced filters?
- [ ] How do we handle caching conflicts between endpoints?
- [ ] Should we warn users about performance implications of description_filter with 7-day endpoint?

**Dependencies:**
