### Feature Request #4: Multiple RapidAPI Endpoint Selection

**Status:** Planning Phase
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** Allow developers to choose between different job freshness levels (7 days, 24 hours, or hourly) to get the most relevant results for their search needs and optimize API usage patterns.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to select how fresh I want my job search results to be (from the last 7 days, 24 hours, or past hour), so that I can find the newest opportunities when needed or search broader when exploring more options.

**Success Metrics:**

- Increased user engagement with time-sensitive job searches
- Better API credit efficiency through targeted endpoint usage
- Reduced search time for users looking for fresh opportunities
- Improved user satisfaction with result relevance

**Available API Endpoints (✅ All Available):**

- **7 Days Endpoint** (`active-jb-7d`) - Jobs from last 7 days ✅ **Currently Implemented**
- **24 Hours Endpoint** (`active-jb-24h`) - Jobs indexed in last 24 hours ⚠️ **API Available, Not Implemented**
- **Hourly Endpoint** (`active-jb-1h`) - Jobs from last hour (Ultra & Mega plans only) ⚠️ **API Available, Not Implemented**

**Key Benefits by Endpoint:**

- **7 Days**: Broadest selection, good for comprehensive searches
- **24 Hours**: Fresh opportunities, better for daily job hunting
- **Hourly**: Latest postings, optimal for premium users with urgent needs

**Technical Implementation Plan:**

1. **Backend Enhancement** - Make API endpoint dynamic based on user selection
2. **Parameter Addition** - Add `endpoint` or `time_range` parameter to search
3. **Frontend UI** - Add endpoint selector in search filters
4. **Plan Validation** - Check user's API plan for Hourly endpoint access
5. **Cache Strategy** - Separate caching by endpoint to avoid conflicts

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Add endpoint selection UI component in AdvancedFilters
- [ ] Implement dynamic endpoint URL construction in API route
- [ ] Add endpoint parameter to SearchParameters interface
- [ ] Validate Hourly endpoint access based on API plan
- [ ] Update cache keys to include endpoint selection
- [ ] Show endpoint-specific information in search results
- [ ] Add endpoint selection to search form state management
- [ ] Display appropriate warnings for endpoint limitations

**Technical Details from Documentation:**

- **7 Days**: `https://linkedin-job-search-api.p.rapidapi.com/active-jb-7d` (current)
- **24 Hours**: `https://linkedin-job-search-api.p.rapidapi.com/active-jb-24h` (estimated)
- **Hourly**: `https://linkedin-job-search-api.p.rapidapi.com/active-jb-1h` (estimated, Ultra & Mega plans)
- **Performance Note**: `description_filter` has timeout risks with 7-day endpoint, recommended for 24h/Hourly
- **Refresh Schedule**: Hourly refresh with 1-2 hour delay, 2-hour delay for Hourly endpoint

**Implementation Requirements:**

- [ ] **Backend Changes**:
  - Add `endpoint` parameter to SearchParameters interface
  - Update API route to construct dynamic endpoint URLs
  - Add endpoint validation (check plan for Hourly access)
  - Update cache keys to separate by endpoint
- [ ] **Frontend Changes**:
  - Add endpoint selector component (radio buttons or dropdown)
  - Update AdvancedFilters to include time range selection
  - Add endpoint selection to search form state
  - Display endpoint-specific warnings and info
- [ ] **Validation & UX**:
  - Show warning for Hourly endpoint if not on Ultra/Mega plan
  - Display endpoint info (job count estimates, freshness)
  - Add tooltips explaining each endpoint's benefits

**Questions to Resolve:**

- [ ] Should we default to 7-day for broader results or 24h for freshness?
- [ ] How do we handle plan validation for Hourly endpoint?
- [ ] Should we show estimated job counts per endpoint?
- [ ] Do we want to automatically suggest better endpoints based on search criteria?
- [ ] Should endpoint selection be prominent or in advanced filters?

### Feature Request #7: Enhanced Role Selection Persistence with Redux Strategy

**Status:** ✅ **Architecture Decided - Ready for Implementation**
**Priority:** Medium-High

**Goal:** Implement robust role selection persistence that survives browser refresh, page navigation, and temporary network issues while maintaining fast user experience.

**User Story:** As a user selecting roles for cover letter/outreach generation, I want my selections to persist across browser sessions and page refreshes, so that I don't lose my work and can continue where I left off even if I accidentally close the browser or navigate away.

**Success Metrics:**

- Role selections persist across browser refresh (100% success rate)
- Fast loading on return (< 500ms to restore state)
- Graceful degradation when cache/persistence fails
- No data loss during normal user workflows
- Reduced user frustration from losing selections

**📋 ARCHITECTURAL DECISION COMPLETED**

After conducting comprehensive analysis detailed in [`REDIS_VS_REDUX_DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md`](./REDIS_VS_REDUX_DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md), the decision is:

**✅ FINAL APPROACH: Redux Persist with Careful Implementation**

**Why Redux Persist is the Right Choice:**

1. **User-specific data** - Role selections are personal to each user
2. **Should survive browser refresh** - Core requirement of the feature
3. **Relatively small data** - Role IDs and metadata fit well in browser storage
4. **Instant loading desired** - No server roundtrips on app startup
5. **Matches our existing patterns** - We already use Redux for role selection state

**Why NOT Redis for this use case:**

- Role selections are user-specific, not shared across users
- Data size is small enough for client-side storage
- Server-side caching would add unnecessary network latency
- Redis should be reserved for expensive/shared data (which this isn't)

**Key Architecture Insights from Framework Analysis:**

- ✅ **Redis** excels for expensive, shared, server-side data (our gamification, CV analysis, API responses)
- ✅ **Redux Persist** is optimal for user-specific data that should survive sessions
- ✅ **Standard Redux** handles real-time, temporary, UI-focused data

**Risk Mitigation (Based on Previous Issues):**

- ✅ **Include all necessary fields** in whitelist to avoid missing data
- ✅ **Use autoMergeLevel2** for better state reconciliation
- ✅ **Check data existence primarily** rather than strict ID comparisons
- ✅ **Remove unstable dependencies** from useEffect hooks
- ✅ **Implement proper migration strategy** for schema changes

**Implementation Plan:**

**Phase 1: RapidAPI Cache Manager Extension (2 days)**

**File: `lib/api/rapidapi-cache.ts`**

- [ ] Add `RoleStateCache` class extending existing `RapidApiCacheManager`
- [ ] Implement `setUserRoleState(userId: string, roleState: UserRoleState): void` method
- [ ] Implement `getUserRoleState(userId: string): UserRoleState | null` method
- [ ] Implement `clearUserRoleState(userId: string): void` method for logout
- [ ] Add `cleanupExpiredRoleStates(): void` method using existing cleanup patterns

- [ ] Middleware should intercept actions: `setRoles`, `toggleRole`, `addRole`, `removeRole`
- [ ] Debounce persistence calls (500ms) to avoid excessive cache writes
- [ ] Add user session validation before persisting or restoring

**Phase 3: Server-Side Session Enhancement (2 days)**

**File: `lib/redis.ts`**

- [ ] Add `setUserRoleState(userId: string, roleState: UserRoleState): Promise<boolean>` function
- [ ] Add `getUserRoleState(userId: string): Promise<UserRoleState | null>` function
- [ ] Add `clearUserRoleState(userId: string): Promise<void>` function
- [ ] Use existing `setCache` and `getCache` functions with key pattern `user_role_state:${userId}`
- [ ] Set 24h TTL using existing `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` constant (extend to 86400)
- [ ] Add to existing error handling patterns in `redis.ts`

**Integration with Authentication:**

- [ ] Hook into NextAuth session creation/destruction in `lib/auth.ts`
- [ ] On session creation, attempt to restore role state from Redis
- [ ] On session destruction, clear both client cache and Redis cache
- [ ] Add user ID extraction utility for cache key generation

**Session Storage Data Structure:**

- [ ] Add URL parameter parsing for `selectedRoles` (comma-separated role IDs)
- [ ] Add URL parameter parsing for `searchQuery`, `location`, `remote` basic search params
- [ ] Implement `useEffect` hook to check URL params on page load
- [ ] Priority order: 1) Client cache, 2) Redis cache, 3) URL params, 4) Empty state
- [ ] Add URL updating when role selection changes (without page reload)

**File: `app/developer/writing-help/page.tsx`**

- [ ] Modify redirect logic to check for persisted selected roles before redirecting
- [ ] If `selectedRoles` exist in cache/Redis, allow page to render normally
- [ ] If no selected roles found, redirect to search with URL params intact
- [ ] Add loading state while checking for persisted roles

**URL Parameter Specification:**

- [ ] `selectedRoles`: Comma-separated list of role IDs (max 10 for URL length)
- [ ] `q`: Search query string (URL encoded)
- [ ] `location`: Location filter (URL encoded)
- [ ] `remote`: Boolean for remote work preference
- [ ] Use Next.js `useRouter` and `useSearchParams` for URL manipulation

**Phase 5: Component Integration & Data Flow (1 day)**

- [ ] Add error boundary for cache failures

**File: `components/roles/AdvancedFilters.tsx`**

- [ ] Persist filter state as part of `lastSearchParams`
- [ ] Restore filter state on page load from cache
- [ ] Clear filter state when user explicitly resets

**Data Flow Architecture:**

- [ ] User action (select role) → Redux action → Middleware → Client cache → Redis backup
- [ ] Page load → Check client cache → Fallback to Redis → Fallback to URL → Default empty
- [ ] Session end → Clear client cache → Clear Redis cache
- [ ] 24h expiry → Automatic cleanup of both client and Redis cache

**Phase 6: Error Handling & Fallbacks (1 day)**

**Cache Failure Scenarios:**

- [ ] Client cache unavailable → Fallback to Redis
- [ ] Redis unavailable → Fallback to URL params
- [ ] URL params invalid → Fallback to empty state
- [ ] Corrupted cache data → Clear cache and fallback to next level
- [ ] Session mismatch → Clear cache and start fresh

**Error Handling Requirements:**

- [ ] Silent failures for cache operations (don't break user experience)
- [ ] Logging for cache failures using existing error reporting
- [ ] Graceful degradation at each fallback level
- [ ] Cache corruption detection and auto-recovery
- [ ] User session validation before cache operations

**Testing Integration Points:**

- [ ] Mock `roleStateCache` for unit tests
- [ ] Mock Redis operations for integration tests

- [ ] Writing-help page allows access when selectedRoles exist in cache
- [ ] Search parameters (query, location, remote) are restored exactly
- [ ] Multiple search sessions can be cached for different users simultaneously
- [ ] Cache automatically expires after 24h with cleanup verification

**Data Integrity:**

- [ ] User A cannot access User B's cached role state
- [ ] Session validation prevents unauthorized cache access
- [ ] Corrupted cache data triggers automatic cleanup and fallback
- [ ] Cache key collisions are impossible between users
- [ ] State restoration validates data types and structure

**Performance Requirements:**

- [ ] Initial page load with cache check completes in < 200ms
- [ ] Role selection triggers cache persistence in < 100ms
- [ ] Cache cleanup runs without blocking user actions
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 10MB for role state cache
- [ ] No memory leaks after 24h of continuous usage

**Error Handling:**

- [ ] Redis unavailable → Graceful fallback to URL params
- [ ] Client cache disabled → Fallback to Redis works
- [ ] URL params corrupted → Fallback to empty search
- [ ] Session expired → Clear all caches and start fresh
- [ ] Cache writes fail → User experience unaffected

**Integration Points:**

- [ ] NextAuth session creation/destruction triggers cache management
- [ ] Redux actions automatically trigger persistence without developer intervention
- [ ] Existing RapidAPI cache patterns remain unaffected
- [ ] URL updates reflect current state without page reload
- [ ] Component remounts restore state correctly

**Security & Privacy:**

- [ ] Cache entries include session validation tokens
- [ ] User logout clears both client and Redis caches
- [ ] No sensitive data (passwords, tokens) stored in cache
- [ ] Cache keys use secure hashing for user identification
- [ ] Cross-session contamination testing passes

**Questions to Resolve:**

- [ ] Writing-help page access with persisted selected roles
- [ ] Cache expiration after 24h verification
- [ ] Multi-user session isolation testing
- [ ] Error fallback scenarios (Redis down, corrupted cache, etc.)

**Performance Tests Required:**

- [ ] Cache operation performance under load (100 concurrent users)
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring during extended sessions
- [ ] Page load time with cache restoration
- [ ] Redis connection pool usage under normal load

**Security Tests Required:**

- [ ] Cross-user cache access prevention
- [ ] Session token validation
- [ ] Cache key collision resistance
- [ ] Unauthorized cache access attempts

**Monitoring & Observability:**

**Metrics to Track:**

- [ ] Cache hit/miss ratios for client and Redis cache
- [ ] Cache operation latency (set/get/cleanup)
- [ ] Memory usage of client cache over time
- [ ] Redis connection pool utilization
- [ ] Session validation failure rates
- [ ] Cache corruption detection frequency

**Alerting Thresholds:**

- [ ] Cache hit ratio below 80% (indicates cache issues)
- [ ] Cache operation latency above 100ms (performance degradation)
- [ ] Memory usage above 10MB (potential memory leak)
- [ ] Redis connection pool above 80% usage (scale concern)
- [ ] Session validation failures above 5% (security concern)

**Logging Requirements:**

- [ ] Cache operations (set/get/delete) with user ID and timestamp
- [ ] Session validation failures with reason codes
- [ ] Cache cleanup operations with statistics
- [ ] Fallback activations (Redis → URL params)
- [ ] Error conditions with stack traces

**Rollback Procedures:**

- [ ] Feature flag to disable role state persistence
- [ ] Cache flush procedure for corrupted data
- [ ] Redis cache namespace isolation for safe cleanup
- [ ] Redux state reset procedure for emergency cases

**Technical Considerations:**

- **Leverage existing Redis patterns** from gamification system
- **Extend proven RapidAPI cache manager** instead of new persistence
- **Use existing session management** for user-specific state
- **Simple URL-based fallback** for basic persistence
- **No localStorage complexity** or client-side persistence issues

**Performance Considerations:**

- Uses existing proven cache performance patterns
- No additional client-side storage or rehydration overhead
- Leverages existing Redis connection pooling and management
- Consistent with current application performance characteristics

**Risk Assessment & Mitigation:**

**High-Risk Areas Identified:**

1. **Redis Connection Pool Exhaustion**

   - Risk: Adding role state caching could overwhelm Redis connection pool
   - Mitigation: Use existing Redis instance with connection pooling limits
   - Monitoring: Track connection usage in existing Redis metrics
2. **Memory Leak in Client Cache**

   - Risk: Map-based cache could grow indefinitely with user sessions
   - Mitigation: Implement strict cache size limits (50 users max) and automatic cleanup
   - Monitoring: Memory usage tracking in cache manager
3. **Session Validation Complexity**

   - Risk: Complex session validation could create security vulnerabilities
   - Mitigation: Use existing NextAuth session patterns, simple token validation
   - Monitoring: Failed session validation alerts
4. **Cache Key Collisions**

   - Risk: Multiple users could have cache key conflicts
   - Mitigation: Use hashed userId + sessionId for unique keys
   - Monitoring: Cache key collision detection in metrics
5. **Redux State Synchronization**

   - Risk: Client cache and Redux state could become out of sync
   - Mitigation: Single source of truth pattern, middleware handles sync
   - Monitoring: State consistency validation in development

**Low-Risk Areas (Proven Patterns):**

- ✅ Redis caching patterns (already working in gamification)
- ✅ RapidAPI cache manager extension (proven architecture)
- ✅ NextAuth session management (existing integration)
- ✅ URL parameter handling (Next.js standard patterns)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: If Redis fails, immediately fallback to URL params
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Each fallback layer is simpler than the previous
3. **Monitoring & Alerting**: Track cache hit rates, memory usage, connection health
4. **Incremental Rollout**: Deploy to small user group first, monitor metrics
5. **Rollback Plan**: Can disable feature flag and revert to stateless behavior

**Estimated Timeline:** 1 week total (vs 2-3 weeks for Redux Persist)
**Risk Level:** Low-Medium - Uses proven patterns with careful risk mitigation
**Complexity:** Low - Extends existing architecture rather than adding new layers

- ❌ Custom styled: `border border-base-300/50`
- ❌ CV management: `border-2 border-dashed`

**Padding Variations:**

- ❌ Writing help: `px-6 py-3`
- ❌ Generate all: `px-8 py-3`
- ❌ Multi-role: `px-4 py-2`
- ❌ LinkedIn: `px-6 py-4`

**Transition Duration Inconsistencies:**

- ❌ 150ms (writing help page)
- ❌ 200ms (most components)
- ❌ 300ms (some cards)
- ❌ Base component: Only `transition-all` (no duration)

**Technical Approach:**

**Phase 1: Enhanced Base Button Component ✅ (Completed)**

- ✅ Updated Button component with standardized `transition-all duration-200`
- ✅ Added LinkedIn variant: `variant="linkedin"` for consistent LinkedIn-style buttons
- ✅ Added glass variants: `variant="glass"` and `variant="glass-outline"`
- ✅ Enhanced size variants with consistent `xl` size
- ✅ Improved rounded corner variants (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, full)
- ✅ Standardized elevation system with `elevation="md"` as default
- ✅ Added comprehensive shadow variants (none, sm, md, lg, xl, float)

**Phase 2: Systematic Component Refactoring**

- [ ] **Main Pages** (Priority 1):
  - `app/developer/roles/search/page.tsx` - Replace custom button styling
  - `app/developer/writing-help/page.tsx` - Use standardized variants
  - `app/developer/cv-management/page.tsx` - Convert to component variants
- [ ] **Writing Help Components** (Priority 2):
  - `components/cover-letter-creator.tsx` - Replace LinkedIn-style custom classes
  - `components/outreach-message-generator.tsx` - Use `variant="linkedin"`
  - `components/cover-letter-personalization.tsx` - Standardize tone buttons
- [ ] **Application Components** (Priority 3):
  - `components/roles/ApplicationActionButton.tsx` - Use component variants
  - `components/analysis/AnalysisActionButtons.tsx` - Apply consistent styling

**Phase 2.5: Enhanced Button Component Features (Based on Resolved Questions)**

- [ ] **Theme-Aware Shadows:** Add shadow variants for dark/light themes
- [ ] **Disabled States:** Implement comprehensive disabled styling for all variants
- [ ] **Loading States:** Add loading animations (spinner or icon animation)
- [ ] **Gradient Constraints:** Limit to maximum 2 gradient button types
- [ ] **Icon Button Preparation:** Architecture for future icon-only styling

**Phase 3: Style Guide Documentation**

- [ ] Create button usage guide with variant examples
- [ ] Document when to use each elevation level
- [ ] Provide migration guide for existing components
- [ ] Add Storybook stories for all button variants

**Standardization Rules:**

**1. Consistent Shadows (Elevation System):**

- `elevation="none"` - No shadow (ghost, link buttons)
- `elevation="sm"` - Subtle shadow (outline, secondary buttons)
- `elevation="md"` - Standard shadow (default for most buttons) ✅ **Now Default**
- `elevation="lg"` - Prominent shadow (important actions)
- `elevation="xl"` - Maximum shadow (hero CTAs)
- `elevation="float"` - Animated shadow with hover lift

**2. Standardized Variants:**

- `variant="default"` - Primary actions (with md shadow)
- `variant="outline"` - Secondary actions (with sm shadow)
- `variant="ghost"` - Tertiary actions (no shadow)
- `variant="linkedin"` - LinkedIn-style gradient (with md shadow) ✅ **New**
- `variant="glass"` - Modern glass effect (with md shadow) ✅ **New**
- `variant="glass-outline"` - Subtle glass outline (with sm shadow) ✅ **New**

**3. Consistent Sizing:**

- `size="sm"` - Compact buttons (btn-sm + appropriate padding)
- `size="default"` - Standard buttons (default DaisyUI sizing)
- `size="lg"` - Large buttons (btn-lg)
- `size="xl"` - Extra large (btn-lg + px-8 py-4 text-base) ✅ **Enhanced**

**4. Rounded Corners:**

- `rounded="default"` - DaisyUI default (rounded)
- `rounded="lg"` - Consistent with cards (rounded-lg)
- `rounded="full"` - Pills/icon buttons

**5. Transitions:**

- ✅ All buttons: `transition-all duration-200` (now standardized)
- Hover effects: Consistent shadow elevation increases
- Focus states: Standardized ring styles

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Component Consistency:**

- [ ] All buttons in main pages use component variants instead of custom classes
- [ ] LinkedIn-style buttons consistently use `variant="linkedin"`
- [ ] Glass effect buttons use `variant="glass"` or `variant="glass-outline"`
- [ ] Shadow levels follow elevation system across all buttons
- [ ] Transition durations are consistent (200ms) for all buttons

**Implementation Standards:**

- [ ] No more custom `px-* py-*` overrides on buttons
- [ ] No more custom `shadow-*` classes on buttons
- [ ] No more custom `transition-*` overrides on buttons
- [ ] No more custom `border-*` classes for standard button styles
- [ ] No more `

### Feature Request #9: Comprehensive CV Data Persistence to Developer Database Profile

**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Priority:** High

**Goal:** Automatically and seamlessly save all extracted CV data to the developer's database profile during CV upload and analysis updates, using existing profile update infrastructure for invisible background synchronization.

**User Story:** As a developer uploading my CV, I want all my extracted information (skills, experience, education, contact details, achievements) to be automatically saved to my profile in the background, so that I can immediately benefit from role matching and profile completion without any visible loading states or confirmation dialogs.

**Success Metrics:**

- 100% of successfully parsed CV data is saved to developer profile seamlessly
- Zero user-visible UI changes - completely background operation
- Profile completion improvements happen instantly after CV upload
- Database stays synchronized when users edit CV analysis data
- Increased role matching accuracy due to comprehensive profile data

**🔧 LEVERAGE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE:**

**✅ EXISTING ENDPOINTS TO REUSE:**

1. **`/api/developer/me/profile` (PUT)** - Full profile update with proper Zod validation
2. **`/api/developer/me/cv/confirm` (POST)** - CV analysis to profile (reference implementation)

**✅ EXISTING VALIDATION SCHEMAS:**

1. **`UpdateProfilePayloadSchema`** (`prisma/schemas.ts`) - Complete profile validation
2. **`ProfileUpdateSchema`** (`types/types.ts`) - Alternative validation schema
3. **`UpdateCvAnalysisSchema`** (`types/cv.ts`) - CV analysis data validation

**✅ EXISTING PRISMA UPDATE LOGIC:**

- Skills creation with category management
- Experience/Education/Achievements array replacement
- ContactInfo upsert pattern
- Proper relationship handling

**📋 SIMPLIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:**

**Phase 1: Background Sync Utility (1 day)**

**File: `utils/backgroundProfileSync.ts`**

- [ ] Create `syncCvDataToProfile(developerId: string, analysisData: CvAnalysisData): Promise<void>` function
- [ ] Transform CV analysis data to match `UpdateProfilePayloadSchema` format
- [ ] Make internal API call to existing `/api/developer/me/profile` endpoint
- [ ] Handle errors silently (log but don't break CV upload flow)
- [ ] Add proper data transformation for date fields and enum values

**Data Transformation Functions:**

- [ ] `transformCvToProfileData(cvAnalysis: CvAnalysisData): UpdateProfilePayload`
- [ ] `transformSkills(cvSkills: CvSkill[]): ProfileSkill[]`
- [ ] `transformExperience(cvExp: CvExperience[]): ProfileExperience[]`
- [ ] `transformEducation(cvEdu: CvEducation[]): ProfileEducation[]`
- [ ] `transformAchievements(cvAch: CvAchievement[]): ProfileAchievement[]`
- [ ] `transformContactInfo(cvContact: CvContactInfo): ProfileContactInfo`

**Phase 2: CV Upload Integration (0.5 days)**

**File: `app/api/cv/upload/route.ts`**

- [ ] Add `await syncCvDataToProfile(developerId, analysisResult)` after line 119
- [ ] Wrap in try/catch to prevent breaking CV upload if sync fails
- [ ] Add silent logging for sync success/failure

**File: `app/api/cv/upload-gemini/route.ts`**

- [ ] Add identical integration after successful analysis
- [ ] Ensure consistent error handling

**Phase 3: CV Analysis Update Integration (0.5 days)**

- [ ] Silent background sync without affecting response

**File: `app/api/cv-analysis/[id]/save-version/route.ts`**

- [ ] Add sync call after creating new analysis version
- [ ] Maintain profile synchronization across analysis versions

**Phase 4: Error Handling & Monitoring (0.5 days)**

**Background Sync Requirements:**

- [ ] **Silent Operation**: No UI changes, loading states, or user notifications
- [ ] **Error Isolation**: CV upload/analysis continues even if profile sync fails
- [ ] **Retry Logic**: Implement simple retry for transient failures
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Log sync success/failure rates for debugging

**Phase 5: Database Schema (Optional - 0.5 days)**

**Only if Language support is required:**

**File: `prisma/schema.prisma`**

- [ ] Add `Language` and `DeveloperLanguage` models if language skills are needed
- [ ] Add to profile update schemas if implemented

**🔄 SEAMLESS BACKGROUND SYNC FLOW:**

**Initial CV Upload:**
1. User uploads CV → Analysis completes ✅
2. **Background**: Transform analysis data to profile format
3. **Background**: Call `/api/developer/me/profile` internally
4. **Background**: Profile updated silently
5. User sees CV analysis results (no indication of profile sync)

**CV Analysis Updates:**
1. User edits CV analysis data → Analysis saved ✅
2. **Background**: Transform updated data to profile format
3. **Background**: Call `/api/developer/me/profile` internally
4. **Background**: Profile synchronized with latest changes
5. User continues editing (no indication of sync)

**📊 DATA TRANSFORMATION MAPPING:**

| **CV Analysis Field** | **Profile Schema Field** | **Transformation** |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| `contactInfo.*` | `contactInfo.*` | Direct mapping |
| `about` | `about` | Direct mapping |
| `skills[]` | `skills[]` | Transform level enums |
