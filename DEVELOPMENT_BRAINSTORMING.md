## 💭 Active Feature Requests



### Feature Request #8: Button Styling Consistency & Coherence

**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** Establish consistent button styling patterns across the entire application to improve visual coherence and maintain a professional, polished user experience.

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want all buttons to have consistent styling patterns (shadows, borders, rounded corners, transitions, padding) so that the interface feels cohesive and professional throughout all pages and components.

**Success Metrics:**

- Improved visual consistency across all application pages
- Reduced development time for new button implementations
- Enhanced maintainability through standardized component usage
- Better user experience through predictable UI patterns

**Current Inconsistencies Identified:**

**Shadow Variations:**

- ❌ Some buttons: `shadow-lg` (writing-help page)
- ❌ Some buttons: `shadow-md` (cover letter creator)
- ❌ Some buttons: `shadow-sm` (application buttons)
- ❌ Many buttons: No shadows at all
- ✅ Base component: Has elevation variants but rarely used

**Border Inconsistencies:**

- ❌ LinkedIn buttons: `border-0` custom override
- ❌ Default buttons: Mixed DaisyUI borders
- ❌ Custom styled: `border border-base-300/50`
- ❌ CV management: `border-2 border-dashed`

**Padding Variations:**

- ❌ Writing help: `px-6 py-3`
- ❌ Generate all: `px-8 py-3`
- ❌ Multi-role: `px-4 py-2`
- ❌ LinkedIn: `px-6 py-4`

**Transition Duration Inconsistencies:**

- ❌ 150ms (writing help page)
- ❌ 200ms (most components)
- ❌ 300ms (some cards)
- ❌ Base component: Only `transition-all` (no duration)

**Technical Approach:**

**Phase 1: Enhanced Base Button Component ✅ (Completed)**

- ✅ Updated Button component with standardized `transition-all duration-200`
- ✅ Added LinkedIn variant: `variant="linkedin"` for consistent LinkedIn-style buttons
- ✅ Added glass variants: `variant="glass"` and `variant="glass-outline"`
- ✅ Enhanced size variants with consistent `xl` size
- ✅ Improved rounded corner variants (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, full)
- ✅ Standardized elevation system with `elevation="md"` as default
- ✅ Added comprehensive shadow variants (none, sm, md, lg, xl, float)

**Phase 2: Systematic Component Refactoring**

- [ ] **Main Pages** (Priority 1):
  - `app/developer/roles/search/page.tsx` - Replace custom button styling
  - `app/developer/writing-help/page.tsx` - Use standardized variants

- [ ] Document when to use each elevation level
- [ ] Provide migration guide for existing components
- [ ] Add Storybook stories for all button variants

**Standardization Rules:**

**1. Consistent Shadows (Elevation System):**

- `elevation="none"` - No shadow (ghost, link buttons)
- `elevation="sm"` - Subtle shadow (outline, secondary buttons)
- `elevation="md"` - Standard shadow (default for most buttons) ✅ **Now Default**
- `elevation="lg"` - Prominent shadow (important actions)
- `elevation="xl"` - Maximum shadow (hero CTAs)
- `elevation="float"` - Animated shadow with hover lift

**2. Standardized Variants:**

- `variant="default"` - Primary actions (with md shadow)

### Feature Request #9: Comprehensive CV Data Persistence to Developer Database Profile

**Status:** Incomplete / Buggy
**Priority:** Critical

**Goal:** Fix the broken data persistence flow to ensure all extracted CV data is automatically and seamlessly saved to the developer's database profile, both on initial upload and when AI-driven suggestions are accepted.

**User Story (Revised):** As a developer, when I upload my CV or accept AI-generated improvements, I expect all my information (skills, experience, education, contact details, achievements) to be automatically and correctly saved to my profile in the background. This should happen seamlessly so I can immediately benefit from accurate role matching and profile completion without extra steps or manual data entry.

**Identified Bugs / Gaps:**

1.  **Initial Upload Sync Failure**: The background sync (`syncCvDataToProfile`) after a new CV is uploaded is failing silently. While the `CvAnalysis` record is created, the data is **not** propagated to the developer's main profile tables (`Experience`, `Education`, `DeveloperSkill`, etc.).
2.  **"AI Suggestions" Don't Persist**: When a user accepts AI suggestions on the CV analysis page, the changes are only reflected in the local Redux state. There is **no API call** to update the `CvAnalysis` record in the database or to trigger a profile sync with the new information.

**🔧 REVISED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:**

**Phase 1: Fix and Verify Background Sync Utility (1 day)**

**File: `utils/backgroundProfileSync.ts`**

- [ ] **Investigate & Fix**: Thoroughly debug the existing `syncCvDataToProfile` function. The logic likely fails during data transformation (e.g., incorrect date formats, enum mismatches, or invalid schema mapping). Add robust logging to pinpoint the exact failure point.
- [ ] **Data Transformation**: Ensure all CV analysis fields are correctly mapped to the `UpdateProfilePayloadSchema`. Pay close attention to nested objects, arrays, and date/enum conversions.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to log detailed error messages to the server console instead of failing silently. This is critical for future debugging.
- [ ] **Testing**: Create a standalone test script (`scripts/test-profile-sync.js`) to invoke this function with sample `CvAnalysis` data to verify it works reliably before integrating it back into the API routes.

**Phase 2: Implement "Accept AI Suggestions" Workflow (1.5 days)**

- [ ] **New API Endpoint**: Create a new endpoint: `PUT /api/cv-analysis/[id]`. This endpoint will accept a new `analysisResult` in its request body.
    - **File**: `app/api/cv-analysis/[id]/route.ts` (implement the `PUT` handler).
- [ ] **Backend Logic**:
    - The `PUT` handler must first validate the incoming data against the `UpdateCvAnalysisSchema`.
    - It will then update the corresponding `CvAnalysis` document in the database with the new `analysisResult`.
    - **Crucially**, after successfully updating the database, it must call the now-fixed `syncCvDataToProfile` function to ensure the developer's profile is updated with the new information.
- [ ] **Frontend Integration**:
    - In `components/analysis/AnalysisResultDisplay.tsx`, modify the `handleAcceptSuggestion` function.
    - When a user accepts a change, it should make a `PUT` request to the new `/api/cv-analysis/[id]` endpoint, sending the updated `analysisResult` object.
    - Upon a successful API response, it should update the local Redux state to reflect that the changes are now permanently saved.

**Phase 3: Re-integrate and Verify End-to-End Flow (1 day)**

- [ ] **CV Upload Routes**: Once `backgroundProfileSync.ts` is fixed and verified, re-test the full upload flow for both `/api/cv/upload/route.ts` and `/api/cv/upload-gemini/route.ts` to confirm the initial sync works as expected.
- [ ] **CV Analysis Update Route**: Verify that editing a CV analysis via the "Accept AI Suggestions" feature correctly updates the database and syncs the profile.
- [ ] **Remove Redundant Code**: The `save-version` route might become obsolete or need refactoring. Analyze if its functionality is covered by the new `PUT` endpoint and simplify if possible.

**✅ REVISED ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**

- [ ] **Initial Upload Sync**: Uploading a new CV successfully populates the developer's `Experience`, `Education`, and `DeveloperSkill` tables in the database.
- [ ] **Accept Suggestions Persistence**: Accepting an AI suggestion on the CV analysis page triggers a `PUT` request, updates the `CvAnalysis` record, and syncs the changes to the developer's profile.
- [ ] **Data Integrity**: The developer's profile in the database accurately reflects the data from the latest version of their CV analysis.
- [ ] **Robust Error Logging**: Any failure in the background sync process is logged with detailed error messages on the server, but does **not** break the user-facing operation (like CV upload).
- [ ] **No User-Facing Changes**: The entire synchronization process remains invisible to the user.

### Feature Request #11: Post-Signup Success Message on Sign-In Page

**Status:** Planning Phase
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** To provide clear feedback to a user after they have successfully created an account, informing them that their account is ready and they can now sign in.

**User Story:** As a new user, after I complete the sign-up process, I want to see a confirmation message on the sign-in page so that I know my account was created successfully and I can proceed to log in.

**Success Metrics:**

- Reduced user confusion after sign-up.
- A clear visual indicator is present on the sign-in page for users who have just signed up.
- Increase in successful first-time logins after registration.

**Technical Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Backend (Sign-up API):** The registration API route (`/api/auth/register/route.ts`) will, upon successful account creation, redirect the user to the sign-in page with a success query parameter (e.g., `/auth/signin?signup=success`).
2.  **Frontend (Sign-in Page):** The sign-in page (`/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`) will read the query parameter from the URL.
3.  **UI Display:** If the `signup=success` parameter is present, a dismissible success alert will be rendered on the page, displaying the confirmation message.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] On successful registration, the user is redirected to `/auth/signin?signup=success`.
- [ ] The sign-in page checks for the `signup=success` query parameter on load.
- [ ] If the parameter is present, an alert component is displayed with the text: "Your account has been successfully created. You can now sign in with your email."
- [ ] The alert is styled with a success theme (e.g., green background/border).
- [ ] The message should be displayed prominently under the "Welcome to TechRec" heading.
- [ ] The message does not appear on subsequent visits to the sign-in page (i.e., when the query parameter is not present).

**Questions to Resolve:**

- [ ] What should be the exact styling of the success message? Should it use the existing `Alert` component?
- [ ] Should the success message be dismissible by the user? (Recommended: Yes, for a cleaner UI after they've read it).
- [ ] Are there different sign-in pages for different user types (e.g., developer vs. company) that need this logic, or does `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` handle all cases?

**Dependencies:**

- [ ] Modification of `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` to include the redirect with a query parameter.
- [ ] Modification of `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` to handle the query parameter and display the message.
- [ ] An existing, styleable `Alert` component for displaying the message.

### Feature Request #14: Comprehensive Cache Invalidation on Sign-Out

**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Priority:** High

**Goal:** To ensure all user-specific data is completely cleared from both client-side (browser) and server-side (Redis) caches upon user sign-out. This guarantees data privacy, prevents state-related bugs for subsequent users on the same browser, and ensures a clean application state.

**User Story:** As a user, when I sign out of the application, I expect all of my personal data and session information to be securely and completely removed from the browser and server caches, so that my privacy is protected and the application is reset to a clean, default state for the next user.

**Success Metrics:**

- 100% of persisted Redux state is cleared from `localStorage` on sign-out.
- All user-specific Redis keys are successfully deleted from the server-side cache on sign-out.
- No user data from a previous session is visible after signing out and signing in with a different account on the same browser.
- A significant reduction in bug reports related to inconsistent state after user sign-out/sign-in cycles.

## 🔧 **DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Backend API Endpoint Creation**

**File:** `app/api/auth/clear-session-cache/route.ts`

**Implementation Requirements:**

```typescript
// Required imports and structure
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth'
import { authOptions } from '@/lib/auth'
import { GamificationQueryOptimizer } from '@/lib/gamification/queryOptimizer'

// POST handler implementation
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // 1. Session validation
  // 2. User ID extraction
  // 3. Cache invalidation using existing infrastructure
  // 4. Error handling with graceful degradation
  // 5. Response with success/failure status
}
```

**Specific Implementation Details:**

1. **Session Validation:**
   - Use `getServerSession(authOptions)` to validate the user session
   - Return 401 if no valid session exists
   - Extract `userId` from session object

2. **Cache Invalidation:**
   - Call `GamificationQueryOptimizer.getInstance().invalidateUserCaches(userId)`
   - This method already handles all user-specific Redis patterns:
     - `user_profile:${userId}`
     - `cv_count:${userId}:*`
     - `app_stats:${userId}`
     - `badge_eval_batch:*${userId}*`
     - `leaderboard:*`

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Wrap cache invalidation in try-catch
   - Log errors but return success status (don't block logout)
   - Include debug information in development mode

4. **Response Format:**
   ```typescript
   return NextResponse.json({
     success: true,
     message: 'Cache cleared successfully',
     clearedKeys: number, // for debugging
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
   })
   ```

### **Phase 2: Frontend Integration**

**File:** `components/nav.tsx`

**Modification to `handleLogout` function:**

```typescript
const handleLogout = async () => {
  setIsNavigating(true)
  
  try {
    // NEW: Call cache clearing endpoint
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/auth/clear-session-cache', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
      })
      
      if (response.ok) {
        console.log('[Logout] Server-side cache cleared successfully')
      } else {
        console.warn('[Logout] Server-side cache clearing failed, continuing with logout')
      }
    } catch (cacheError) {
      console.warn('[Logout] Cache clearing request failed:', cacheError)
      // Continue with logout regardless of cache clearing failure
    }
    
    // ✅ EXISTING: Client-side cache clearing (already implemented)
    dispatch(userLoggedOut())
    await persistor.purge()
    await signOut({ redirect: false })
    
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
      console.log('[Logout] Complete cleanup: Redux state cleared and persistor purged')
    }
    
    router.push('/')
    router.refresh()
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Logout error:', error)
    router.push('/')
    router.refresh()
  } finally {
    setIsNavigating(false)
  }
}
```

**Key Implementation Notes:**

- **Non-blocking:** Cache clearing failure doesn't prevent user logout
- **Graceful degradation:** Existing client-side clearing continues to work
- **Error logging:** Comprehensive logging for debugging
- **Backwards compatible:** No breaking changes to existing functionality

### **Phase 3: Testing & Validation**

**Manual Testing Checklist:**

1. **Cache Clearing Validation:**
   - [ ] User-specific Redis keys are deleted after logout
   - [ ] Client-side localStorage is cleared
   - [ ] Redux state is reset to initial values

2. **Multi-User Testing:**
   - [ ] Sign in as User A, perform actions, sign out
   - [ ] Sign in as User B on same browser
   - [ ] Verify no User A data is visible to User B

3. **Error Resilience:**
   - [ ] Test logout when Redis is unavailable
   - [ ] Test logout when API endpoint fails
   - [ ] Verify user is still logged out in failure scenarios

4. **Performance Testing:**
   - [ ] Measure logout time impact
   - [ ] Verify no UI blocking during cache clearing
   - [ ] Test with large amounts of cached data

### **Phase 4: Monitoring & Observability**

**Logging Strategy:**

1. **Development Logging:**
   - Detailed cache clearing operations
   - Key patterns and counts
   - Performance metrics

2. **Production Logging:**
   - Error rates and types
   - Cache clearing success/failure rates
   - Performance impact metrics

**Monitoring Points:**

- Cache clearing API endpoint response times
- Redis operation success rates
- User logout completion rates
- Error frequency and patterns

## ✅ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **Backend Implementation**
-   [ ] **API Endpoint Created:** `POST /api/auth/clear-session-cache` endpoint exists at the correct file path
-   [ ] **Session Security:** Endpoint validates user session using `getServerSession(authOptions)`
-   [ ] **Cache Invalidation:** Endpoint calls `GamificationQueryOptimizer.getInstance().invalidateUserCaches(userId)`
-   [ ] **Error Handling:** Endpoint handles Redis failures gracefully and returns success status
-   [ ] **Response Format:** Endpoint returns structured JSON with success status and debug information

### **Frontend Integration**
-   [ ] **API Call Integration:** `handleLogout` function calls the cache clearing endpoint
-   [ ] **Non-blocking Behavior:** Cache clearing failures don't prevent user logout
-   [ ] **Error Logging:** Comprehensive logging for debugging cache clearing operations
-   [ ] ✅ **Client-side Clearing:** `persistor.purge()` and `userLoggedOut()` already implemented
-   [ ] **Backwards Compatibility:** No breaking changes to existing logout functionality

### **Data Privacy & Security**
-   [ ] **Redis Cache Clearing:** User-specific Redis keys are deleted after logout:
    - `user_profile:${userId}` (gamification profiles)
    - `cv_count:${userId}:*` (CV count caches)
    - `app_stats:${userId}` (application statistics)
    - `badge_eval_batch:*${userId}*` (badge evaluation caches)
    - `leaderboard:*` (leaderboard invalidation)
-   [ ] **Client-side Clearing:** localStorage and Redux state completely cleared
-   [ ] **Multi-user Privacy:** No data leakage between different users on same browser

### **Testing & Validation**
-   [ ] **Functional Testing:** Multi-user scenario testing confirms no data leakage
-   [ ] **Error Resilience:** Logout works when Redis is unavailable
-   [ ] **Performance Testing:** Logout time impact is acceptable (<2 seconds)
-   [ ] **Debug Verification:** Development logging shows cache clearing operations

**Questions to Resolve:**

-   [✅] What is the exact key-naming convention for user-specific data in Redis?
**Answer:** Investigation revealed multiple Redis key patterns used throughout the application:
    - **Gamification**: `user_profile:${userId}`, `cv_count:${userId}:*`, `app_stats:${userId}`, `badge_eval_batch:*${userId}*`
    - **Leaderboards**: `leaderboard:*` (affects all users when any user changes)
    - **CV Analysis**: `cv_analysis:${fileHash}` (not user-specific, but should be cleared for privacy)
    - **Cover Letters**: `cover_letter:${dataHash}` (not user-specific, but should be cleared for privacy)
    - **Config Service**: `config:points-costs`, `config:xp-rewards`, `config:subscription-tiers` (global, should not be cleared)
    - **RapidAPI Cache**: Uses parameter hashes, not user-specific (can remain cached)

-   [✅] How is the `persistor` object currently made available to the UI components?
**Answer:** The `persistor` object is exported from `@/lib/store` and is already imported and used in `components/nav.tsx`. It's available globally through the import system, not through React Context.

-   [✅] Where is the primary sign-out button/logic located?
**Answer:** Located in `components/nav.tsx` in the `UserNav` component, specifically in the `handleLogout` function. **Important discovery**: The current implementation already includes `persistor.purge()` and Redux state clearing via `userLoggedOut()` action.

## 🔗 **DEPENDENCIES & INFRASTRUCTURE**

### **✅ Available Infrastructure (Ready to Use)**
-   **Authentication:** `next-auth/react` and `getServerSession` for session management
-   **Cache Management:** `GamificationQueryOptimizer.invalidateUserCaches()` method already implemented
-   **Client-side Persistence:** `redux-persist` with `persistor.purge()` already integrated
-   **Redis Client:** Available through existing gamification infrastructure
-   **Logout Logic:** `handleLogout` function in `components/nav.tsx` already handles client-side clearing

### **📋 Implementation Requirements**
-   **New API Route:** `app/api/auth/clear-session-cache/route.ts` (needs creation)
-   **Frontend Modification:** Add API call to existing `handleLogout` function
-   **Testing Scripts:** Manual testing checklist and validation procedures

### **🔧 Technical Dependencies**
-   **Session Access:** `@/lib/auth` authOptions configuration
-   **Cache Patterns:** User-specific Redis key patterns (already documented)
-   **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation patterns for cache failures
-   **Logging:** Development and production logging strategies

## 📝 **IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

### **Key Design Decisions**
1. **Non-blocking Design:** Cache clearing failures don't prevent logout
2. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure:** Use `GamificationQueryOptimizer` instead of custom Redis operations
3. **Graceful Degradation:** Maintain existing client-side clearing as fallback
4. **Security First:** Validate session before any cache operations

### **Performance Considerations**
- Cache clearing operations are asynchronous and non-blocking
- Redis operations are batched through existing optimizer
- Client-side clearing continues to work independently
- No impact on user experience during normal logout flow

### **Final Questions to Resolve**
-   [ ] Should the cache clearing API endpoint also clear content-hash based caches (CV analysis, cover letters) for additional privacy, even though they're not user-specific?
-   [ ] Should we add logging/analytics to track cache clearing operations for debugging purposes?
-   [ ] What should be the timeout for the cache clearing API call to avoid blocking logout?
