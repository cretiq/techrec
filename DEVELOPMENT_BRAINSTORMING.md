## 💭 Active Feature Requests

### Feature Request #1: Developer-Role Matching Score System
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Priority:** High

**Goal:** Help developers identify roles they're most likely to match with by providing compatibility scores based on skills, experience, and role requirements

**Success Metrics:** 
- Increase in application conversion rates for high-scoring matches
- User engagement with scoring features
- Reduction in time spent browsing unsuitable roles

**Technical Approach:** 
- Multi-factor matching algorithm with weighted scoring
- Real-time score calculation and display in role cards  
- Score breakdown/explanation for transparency
- Progressive enhancement (start simple, add ML later)

**Matching Factors & Data Sources:**
1. **Skills Matching (40% weight)**
   - Developer: `skills[]` (name, category, level)
   - Role: `skills[]` + `ai_key_skills[]` + `linkedin_org_specialties[]`
   - Algorithm: Fuzzy string matching + skill taxonomy mapping

2. **Experience Level Matching (25% weight)**
   - Developer: Years of experience (calculated from `experience[]`)
   - Role: `seniority` + `ai_experience_level`
   - Algorithm: Range matching (entry/mid/senior/lead)

3. **Location Matching (20% weight)** 
   - Developer: `contactInfo.city`, `contactInfo.country`
   - Role: `locations_derived[]`, `remote_derived`
   - Algorithm: Geographic proximity + remote preference

4. **Tech Stack Matching (10% weight)**
   - Developer: `experience[].techStack[]`
   - Role: `requirements[]` + `ai_requirements_summary`
   - Algorithm: Technology keyword extraction and matching

5. **Company Fit (5% weight)**
   - Developer: Preferences (to be added)
   - Role: `linkedin_org_industry`, `linkedin_org_size`, `linkedin_org_type`
   - Algorithm: Preference-based scoring

**Questions to Resolve:**
- [ ] Should we display scores as percentages (85%), letter grades (A-F), or star ratings (4.2/5)?
- [ ] What's the minimum score threshold to display a match (e.g., hide <30% matches)?
- [ ] How do we handle roles with missing skill/requirement data (default to neutral score?)?
- [ ] Should scoring be real-time or pre-calculated and cached?
- [ ] How detailed should the score breakdown be (overall vs. per-factor)?
- [ ] Do we need user preference settings for adjusting weights?
- [ ] Should we A/B test different scoring algorithms?
- [ ] How do we handle skill name variations (React vs ReactJS vs React.js)?
- [ ] What's the fallback experience for users with incomplete profiles?

**Dependencies:**
- [ ] Comprehensive developer profile data (skills, experience, preferences) ✅ *Mostly available*
- [ ] Enhanced role requirement parsing from job descriptions 
- [ ] Skill taxonomy/mapping system for comparing different skill names
- [ ] User preference settings for weighting factors
- [ ] Performance optimization for real-time scoring calculations

### Feature Request #4: Multiple RapidAPI Endpoint Selection
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** Allow developers to choose between different job freshness levels (7 days, 24 hours, or hourly) to get the most relevant results for their search needs and optimize API usage patterns.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to select how fresh I want my job search results to be (from the last 7 days, 24 hours, or past hour), so that I can find the newest opportunities when needed or search broader when exploring more options.

**Success Metrics:** 
- Increased user engagement with time-sensitive job searches
- Better API credit efficiency through targeted endpoint usage
- Reduced search time for users looking for fresh opportunities
- Improved user satisfaction with result relevance

**Available API Endpoints (✅ All Available):**
- **7 Days Endpoint** (`active-jb-7d`) - Jobs from last 7 days ✅ **Currently Implemented**
- **24 Hours Endpoint** (`active-jb-24h`) - Jobs indexed in last 24 hours ⚠️ **API Available, Not Implemented**
- **Hourly Endpoint** (`active-jb-1h`) - Jobs from last hour (Ultra & Mega plans only) ⚠️ **API Available, Not Implemented**

**Key Benefits by Endpoint:**
- **7 Days**: Broadest selection, good for comprehensive searches
- **24 Hours**: Fresh opportunities, better for daily job hunting
- **Hourly**: Latest postings, optimal for premium users with urgent needs

**Technical Implementation Plan:**
1. **Backend Enhancement** - Make API endpoint dynamic based on user selection
2. **Parameter Addition** - Add `endpoint` or `time_range` parameter to search
3. **Frontend UI** - Add endpoint selector in search filters
4. **Plan Validation** - Check user's API plan for Hourly endpoint access
5. **Cache Strategy** - Separate caching by endpoint to avoid conflicts

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Add endpoint selection UI component in AdvancedFilters
- [ ] Implement dynamic endpoint URL construction in API route
- [ ] Add endpoint parameter to SearchParameters interface
- [ ] Validate Hourly endpoint access based on API plan
- [ ] Update cache keys to include endpoint selection
- [ ] Show endpoint-specific information in search results
- [ ] Add endpoint selection to search form state management
- [ ] Display appropriate warnings for endpoint limitations

**Technical Details from Documentation:**
- **7 Days**: `https://linkedin-job-search-api.p.rapidapi.com/active-jb-7d` (current)
- **24 Hours**: `https://linkedin-job-search-api.p.rapidapi.com/active-jb-24h` (estimated)
- **Hourly**: `https://linkedin-job-search-api.p.rapidapi.com/active-jb-1h` (estimated, Ultra & Mega plans)
- **Performance Note**: `description_filter` has timeout risks with 7-day endpoint, recommended for 24h/Hourly
- **Refresh Schedule**: Hourly refresh with 1-2 hour delay, 2-hour delay for Hourly endpoint

**Implementation Requirements:**
- [ ] **Backend Changes**:
  - Add `endpoint` parameter to SearchParameters interface
  - Update API route to construct dynamic endpoint URLs
  - Add endpoint validation (check plan for Hourly access)
  - Update cache keys to separate by endpoint
- [ ] **Frontend Changes**:
  - Add endpoint selector component (radio buttons or dropdown)
  - Update AdvancedFilters to include time range selection
  - Add endpoint selection to search form state
  - Display endpoint-specific warnings and info
- [ ] **Validation & UX**:
  - Show warning for Hourly endpoint if not on Ultra/Mega plan
  - Display endpoint info (job count estimates, freshness)
  - Add tooltips explaining each endpoint's benefits

**Questions to Resolve:**
- [ ] Should we default to 7-day for broader results or 24h for freshness?
- [ ] How do we handle plan validation for Hourly endpoint?
- [ ] Should we show estimated job counts per endpoint?
- [ ] Do we want to automatically suggest better endpoints based on search criteria?
- [ ] Should endpoint selection be prominent or in advanced filters?
- [ ] How do we handle caching conflicts between endpoints?
- [ ] Should we warn users about performance implications of description_filter with 7-day endpoint?

**Dependencies:**
- [ ] API plan detection mechanism for Hourly endpoint validation
- [ ] Updated SearchParameters interface with endpoint field
- [ ] Enhanced caching strategy to handle multiple endpoints
- [ ] UI component for endpoint selection with clear labeling
- [ ] Documentation updates for endpoint-specific behaviors
