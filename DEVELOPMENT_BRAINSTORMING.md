- **24 Hours Endpoint** (`active-jb-24h`) - Jobs indexed in last 24 hours ⚠️ **API Available, Not Implemented**
- **Hourly Endpoint** (`active-jb-1h`) - Jobs from last hour (Ultra & Mega plans only) ⚠️ **API Available, Not Implemented**

**Key Benefits by Endpoint:**
- **7 Days**: Broadest selection, good for comprehensive searches
- **24 Hours**: Fresh opportunities, better for daily job hunting
- **Hourly**: Latest postings, optimal for premium users with urgent needs

**Technical Implementation Plan:**
1. **Backend Enhancement** - Make API endpoint dynamic based on user selection
2. **Parameter Addition** - Add `endpoint` or `time_range` parameter to search
3. **Frontend UI** - Add endpoint selector in search filters
4. **Plan Validation** - Check user's API plan for Hourly endpoint access
5. **Cache Strategy** - Separate caching by endpoint to avoid conflicts

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Add endpoint selection UI component in AdvancedFilters
- [ ] Implement dynamic endpoint URL construction in API route
- [ ] Add endpoint parameter to SearchParameters interface
- [ ] Validate Hourly endpoint access based on API plan
- [ ] Update cache keys to include endpoint selection
