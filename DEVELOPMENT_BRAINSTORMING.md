   - Role: `skills[]` + `ai_key_skills[]` + `linkedin_org_specialties[]`
   - Algorithm: Fuzzy string matching + skill taxonomy mapping

2. **Experience Level Matching (25% weight)**
   - Developer: Years of experience (calculated from `experience[]`)
   - Role: `seniority` + `ai_experience_level`
   - Algorithm: Range matching (entry/mid/senior/lead)

3. **Location Matching (20% weight)** 
   - Developer: `contactInfo.city`, `contactInfo.country`

### Feature Request #4: Multiple RapidAPI Endpoint Selection
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** Allow developers to choose between different job freshness levels (7 days, 24 hours, or hourly) to get the most relevant results for their search needs and optimize API usage patterns.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to select how fresh I want my job search results to be (from the last 7 days, 24 hours, or past hour), so that I can find the newest opportunities when needed or search broader when exploring more options.

**Success Metrics:** 
- Increased user engagement with time-sensitive job searches
- Better API credit efficiency through targeted endpoint usage
- Reduced search time for users looking for fresh opportunities
- Improved user satisfaction with result relevance

**Available API Endpoints (✅ All Available):**
- **7 Days Endpoint** (`active-jb-7d`) - Jobs from last 7 days ✅ **Currently Implemented**
- **24 Hours Endpoint** (`active-jb-24h`) - Jobs indexed in last 24 hours ⚠️ **API Available, Not Implemented**
- **Hourly Endpoint** (`active-jb-1h`) - Jobs from last hour (Ultra & Mega plans only) ⚠️ **API Available, Not Implemented**

**Key Benefits by Endpoint:**
- **7 Days**: Broadest selection, good for comprehensive searches
- **24 Hours**: Fresh opportunities, better for daily job hunting
- **Hourly**: Latest postings, optimal for premium users with urgent needs

**Technical Implementation Plan:**
1. **Backend Enhancement** - Make API endpoint dynamic based on user selection
2. **Parameter Addition** - Add `endpoint` or `time_range` parameter to search
3. **Frontend UI** - Add endpoint selector in search filters
4. **Plan Validation** - Check user's API plan for Hourly endpoint access
5. **Cache Strategy** - Separate caching by endpoint to avoid conflicts

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Add endpoint selection UI component in AdvancedFilters
- [ ] Implement dynamic endpoint URL construction in API route
- [ ] Add endpoint parameter to SearchParameters interface
- [ ] Validate Hourly endpoint access based on API plan
- [ ] Update cache keys to include endpoint selection
- [ ] Show endpoint-specific information in search results
- [ ] Add endpoint selection to search form state management

- **24 Hours**: `https://linkedin-job-search-api.p.rapidapi.com/active-jb-24h` (estimated)
- **Hourly**: `https://linkedin-job-search-api.p.rapidapi.com/active-jb-1h` (estimated, Ultra & Mega plans)
- **Performance Note**: `description_filter` has timeout risks with 7-day endpoint, recommended for 24h/Hourly
- **Refresh Schedule**: Hourly refresh with 1-2 hour delay, 2-hour delay for Hourly endpoint

**Implementation Requirements:**
- [ ] **Backend Changes**:
  - Add `endpoint` parameter to SearchParameters interface
  - Update API route to construct dynamic endpoint URLs

  - Update cache keys to separate by endpoint
- [ ] **Frontend Changes**:
  - Add endpoint selector component (radio buttons or dropdown)
  - Update AdvancedFilters to include time range selection
  - Add endpoint selection to search form state
  - Display endpoint-specific warnings and info
- [ ] **Validation & UX**:
  - Show warning for Hourly endpoint if not on Ultra/Mega plan
  - Display endpoint info (job count estimates, freshness)
  - Add tooltips explaining each endpoint's benefits

**Questions to Resolve:**
- [ ] Should we default to 7-day for broader results or 24h for freshness?
- [ ] How do we handle plan validation for Hourly endpoint?
- [ ] Should we show estimated job counts per endpoint?
- [ ] Do we want to automatically suggest better endpoints based on search criteria?
- [ ] Should endpoint selection be prominent or in advanced filters?
- [ ] How do we handle caching conflicts between endpoints?
- [ ] Should we warn users about performance implications of description_filter with 7-day endpoint?

### Feature Request #6: Cover Letter Personalization UI Redesign
**Status:** In Development  
**Priority:** High

**Goal:** Improve the cover letter personalization user experience by always showing the most important fields (tone & hiring manager) while hiding less critical fields until expanded, and removing redundant message type selection.

**User Story:** As a developer creating cover letters, I want to see the most important personalization options (tone and hiring manager) immediately visible, with less critical fields collapsible, and without redundant message type selection since I already chose the cover letter tab, so that I can quickly customize my application without UI clutter.

**Success Metrics:** 
- Reduced time to customize cover letter settings
- Increased usage of tone and hiring manager fields
- Improved user satisfaction with personalization workflow
- Cleaner, more focused user interface

**Technical Approach:** 
- **Component Restructure:** Modify CoverLetterPersonalization component to separate always-visible from collapsible fields
- **State Management:** Add expansion/collapse state for optional fields section
- **UI Consistency:** Maintain design system patterns from other expandable sections
- **Field Removal:** Remove message type selection as it's redundant with tab selection
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Use expandable pattern to show advanced options only when needed

**Current Implementation Status:**
- **Partially Complete:** Basic structure exists but needs refinement
- **Always Visible Fields:** Tone & Style, Hiring Manager Name ✅ Implemented
- **Collapsible Fields:** Job Source ✅ Basic implementation exists
- **Message Type Removal:** ⚠️ Needs verification and cleanup

- [ ] Test and refine expand/collapse animations
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness works properly
- [ ] Add comprehensive accessibility testing
- [ ] Verify Redux state management works correctly
- [ ] Test all user interaction flows
- [ ] Polish UI consistency with design system

**Questions to Resolve:**
- [ ] Should the collapsible section be expanded by default for first-time users?
- [ ] What icon should we use for the expand/collapse toggle (ChevronDown, Plus, etc.)?
- [ ] Should we add a subtle animation for the expand/collapse transition?
- [ ] Do we need to persist the expanded/collapsed state across sessions?
- [ ] Should we add a visual indicator showing how many fields are hidden when collapsed?

**Dependencies:**
- [ ] CoverLetterPersonalization component refinement
- [ ] Redux state management cleanup for message type removal
- [ ] Enhanced expand/collapse UI pattern consistency
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for new UI states and interactions

### Feature Request #7: Server-Side Role State Persistence (Revised)
**Status:** Planning Phase - Major Architecture Revision Required  
**Priority:** High

**Goal:** Fix the critical issue where search results and selected roles disappear after page refresh using existing architecture patterns instead of adding complex client-side persistence.

**User Story:** As a developer using the job search functionality, I want my search results and selected roles to persist when I refresh the page or navigate between pages, so that I can continue where I left off without losing my search progress or having to reselect roles.

**Success Metrics:** 
- Elimination of user complaints about losing search results on refresh
- Increased user engagement with multi-page workflows (search → writing-help → back to search)
- Improved user retention in writing-help workflows
- Reduced bounce rate from writing-help page redirects

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS: Original Plan Too Complex

**After thorough analysis of Redux Persist best practices, ioredis patterns, and existing codebase:**

❌ **Original Redux Persist plan would create TRIPLE cache complexity:**
1. RapidAPI in-memory cache (Map-based, working well)
2. Redis server-side cache (gamification, config - working well)  
3. Redux Persist localStorage (new, problematic)

❌ **Previous Redux Persist issues documented in TROUBLESHOOTING.md:**
- State rehydration issues with missing fields
- ID mismatch problems between URL and store
- Infinite useEffect loops and REHYDRATE complications

❌ **User explicitly mentioned "wrestling with cache and state management"**

## ✅ REVISED APPROACH: Leverage Existing Patterns

**Instead of adding Redux Persist complexity, extend the existing architecture patterns:**

**Technical Approach:** 
- **Extend RapidApiCacheManager:** Use existing proven cache patterns for role state
- **Use Redis Infrastructure:** Leverage existing server-side session storage
- **Keep Client Simple:** No localStorage complexity or client-side persistence
- **URL State Backup:** Simple URL parameters for basic persistence fallback

**Advantages of Revised Approach:**
✅ **Uses existing proven patterns** (RapidAPI cache, Redis infrastructure)
✅ **No new dependencies** or complex persistence layers
✅ **Avoids Redux Persist pitfalls** that caused previous issues
✅ **Simpler debugging and maintenance**
✅ **Consistent with existing architecture**
✅ **Lower risk of cache synchronization issues**

**Implementation Plan:**

**Phase 1: RapidAPI Cache Manager Extension (2 days)**

**File: `lib/api/rapidapi-cache.ts`**
- [ ] Add `RoleStateCache` class extending existing `RapidApiCacheManager`
- [ ] Implement `setUserRoleState(userId: string, roleState: UserRoleState): void` method
- [ ] Implement `getUserRoleState(userId: string): UserRoleState | null` method
- [ ] Implement `clearUserRoleState(userId: string): void` method for logout
- [ ] Add `cleanupExpiredRoleStates(): void` method using existing cleanup patterns
- [ ] Extend existing `generateParameterHash()` method to handle role state parameters

- [ ] Apply existing `CACHE_TTL` pattern but with 24h expiration for role states

**Required Interface Definition:**
- [ ] Define `UserRoleState` interface in new file `types/roleState.ts`:
  - `roles: Role[]` - current search results
  - `selectedRoles: string[]` - array of selected role IDs
  - `lastSearchParams: SearchParameters` - last search parameters used
  - `timestamp: number` - when state was cached
  - `sessionId: string` - user session identifier
- [ ] Define `RoleStateCacheEntry` interface extending existing `CacheEntry` pattern

**Integration Points:**
- [ ] Export singleton instance `roleStateCache` similar to existing `RapidApiCacheManager.getInstance()`

- [ ] Middleware should intercept actions: `setRoles`, `toggleRole`, `addRole`, `removeRole`
- [ ] Debounce persistence calls (500ms) to avoid excessive cache writes
- [ ] Add user session validation before persisting or restoring

**Phase 3: Server-Side Session Enhancement (2 days)**

**File: `lib/redis.ts`**
- [ ] Add `setUserRoleState(userId: string, roleState: UserRoleState): Promise<boolean>` function
- [ ] Add `getUserRoleState(userId: string): Promise<UserRoleState | null>` function
- [ ] Add `clearUserRoleState(userId: string): Promise<void>` function
- [ ] Use existing `setCache` and `getCache` functions with key pattern `user_role_state:${userId}`
- [ ] Set 24h TTL using existing `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` constant (extend to 86400)
- [ ] Add to existing error handling patterns in `redis.ts`

**Integration with Authentication:**
- [ ] Hook into NextAuth session creation/destruction in `lib/auth.ts`
- [ ] On session creation, attempt to restore role state from Redis
- [ ] On session destruction, clear both client cache and Redis cache
- [ ] Add user ID extraction utility for cache key generation

**Session Storage Data Structure:**

- [ ] Add URL parameter parsing for `selectedRoles` (comma-separated role IDs)
- [ ] Add URL parameter parsing for `searchQuery`, `location`, `remote` basic search params
- [ ] Implement `useEffect` hook to check URL params on page load
- [ ] Priority order: 1) Client cache, 2) Redis cache, 3) URL params, 4) Empty state
- [ ] Add URL updating when role selection changes (without page reload)

**File: `app/developer/writing-help/page.tsx`**
- [ ] Modify redirect logic to check for persisted selected roles before redirecting
- [ ] If `selectedRoles` exist in cache/Redis, allow page to render normally
- [ ] If no selected roles found, redirect to search with URL params intact
- [ ] Add loading state while checking for persisted roles

**URL Parameter Specification:**
- [ ] `selectedRoles`: Comma-separated list of role IDs (max 10 for URL length)
- [ ] `q`: Search query string (URL encoded)
- [ ] `location`: Location filter (URL encoded)
- [ ] `remote`: Boolean for remote work preference
- [ ] Use Next.js `useRouter` and `useSearchParams` for URL manipulation

**Phase 5: Component Integration & Data Flow (1 day)**

- [ ] Add integration with `roleStateCache.setUserRoleState()` on selection
- [ ] Handle role state restoration on component mount
- [ ] Add error boundary for cache failures

**File: `components/roles/AdvancedFilters.tsx`**
- [ ] Persist filter state as part of `lastSearchParams`
- [ ] Restore filter state on page load from cache
- [ ] Clear filter state when user explicitly resets

**Data Flow Architecture:**
- [ ] User action (select role) → Redux action → Middleware → Client cache → Redis backup
- [ ] Page load → Check client cache → Fallback to Redis → Fallback to URL → Default empty
- [ ] Session end → Clear client cache → Clear Redis cache
- [ ] 24h expiry → Automatic cleanup of both client and Redis cache

**Phase 6: Error Handling & Fallbacks (1 day)**

**Cache Failure Scenarios:**
- [ ] Client cache unavailable → Fallback to Redis
- [ ] Redis unavailable → Fallback to URL params
- [ ] URL params invalid → Fallback to empty state
- [ ] Corrupted cache data → Clear cache and fallback to next level
- [ ] Session mismatch → Clear cache and start fresh

**Error Handling Requirements:**
- [ ] Silent failures for cache operations (don't break user experience)
- [ ] Logging for cache failures using existing error reporting
- [ ] Graceful degradation at each fallback level
- [ ] Cache corruption detection and auto-recovery
- [ ] User session validation before cache operations

**Testing Integration Points:**
- [ ] Mock `roleStateCache` for unit tests
- [ ] Mock Redis operations for integration tests
- [ ] Test URL parameter parsing edge cases
- [ ] Test cross-session contamination prevention
- [ ] Test automatic cleanup and expiration

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Search results persist across page refreshes for 24h
- [ ] Selected roles remain selected after page refresh (up to 10 roles)
- [ ] Writing-help page allows access when selectedRoles exist in cache
- [ ] Search parameters (query, location, remote) are restored exactly
- [ ] Multiple search sessions can be cached for different users simultaneously
- [ ] Cache automatically expires after 24h with cleanup verification

**Data Integrity:**
- [ ] User A cannot access User B's cached role state
- [ ] Session validation prevents unauthorized cache access
- [ ] Corrupted cache data triggers automatic cleanup and fallback
- [ ] Cache key collisions are impossible between users
- [ ] State restoration validates data types and structure

**Performance Requirements:**
- [ ] Initial page load with cache check completes in < 200ms
- [ ] Role selection triggers cache persistence in < 100ms
- [ ] Cache cleanup runs without blocking user actions
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 10MB for role state cache
- [ ] No memory leaks after 24h of continuous usage

**Error Handling:**
- [ ] Redis unavailable → Graceful fallback to URL params
- [ ] Client cache disabled → Fallback to Redis works
- [ ] URL params corrupted → Fallback to empty search
- [ ] Session expired → Clear all caches and start fresh
- [ ] Cache writes fail → User experience unaffected

**Integration Points:**
- [ ] NextAuth session creation/destruction triggers cache management
- [ ] Redux actions automatically trigger persistence without developer intervention
- [ ] Existing RapidAPI cache patterns remain unaffected
- [ ] URL updates reflect current state without page reload
- [ ] Component remounts restore state correctly

**Security & Privacy:**
- [ ] Cache entries include session validation tokens
- [ ] User logout clears both client and Redis caches
- [ ] No sensitive data (passwords, tokens) stored in cache
- [ ] Cache keys use secure hashing for user identification
- [ ] Cross-session contamination testing passes

**Questions to Resolve:**
- [x] Should we add Redux Persist complexity? → **❌ No, use existing patterns**
- [x] Should we leverage existing RapidAPI cache patterns? → **✅ Yes, extend them**
- [x] Should we use existing Redis infrastructure? → **✅ Yes, proven and working**
- [x] Should we keep client-side state simple? → **✅ Yes, avoid localStorage complexity**
- [x] Should we have URL-based fallback? → **✅ Yes, simple and reliable**

**Dependencies:**
- [ ] Extend existing `RapidApiCacheManager` class
- [ ] Use existing Redis infrastructure patterns from `lib/redis.ts`
- [ ] Minimal changes to existing store configuration
- [ ] No new package dependencies required

**Testing Strategy:**

**Unit Tests Required:**

- [ ] Cache key generation and hashing functions
- [ ] Session validation utility functions
- [ ] URL parameter parsing and encoding functions
- [ ] Redux middleware state synchronization logic

**Integration Tests Required:**
- [ ] Redis cache operations with mock Redis instance
- [ ] NextAuth session integration (login/logout cache management)
- [ ] Redux store integration with cache persistence
- [ ] Component integration (RoleCard, AdvancedFilters, SearchPage)
- [ ] URL parameter restoration on page load

**End-to-End Tests Required:**
- [ ] Complete user journey: search → select roles → refresh → verify persistence
- [ ] Writing-help page access with persisted selected roles
- [ ] Cache expiration after 24h verification
- [ ] Multi-user session isolation testing
- [ ] Error fallback scenarios (Redis down, corrupted cache, etc.)

**Performance Tests Required:**
- [ ] Cache operation performance under load (100 concurrent users)
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring during extended sessions
- [ ] Page load time with cache restoration
- [ ] Redis connection pool usage under normal load

**Security Tests Required:**
- [ ] Cross-user cache access prevention
- [ ] Session token validation
- [ ] Cache key collision resistance
- [ ] Unauthorized cache access attempts

**Monitoring & Observability:**

**Metrics to Track:**
- [ ] Cache hit/miss ratios for client and Redis cache
- [ ] Cache operation latency (set/get/cleanup)
- [ ] Memory usage of client cache over time
- [ ] Redis connection pool utilization
- [ ] Session validation failure rates
- [ ] Cache corruption detection frequency

**Alerting Thresholds:**
- [ ] Cache hit ratio below 80% (indicates cache issues)
- [ ] Cache operation latency above 100ms (performance degradation)
- [ ] Memory usage above 10MB (potential memory leak)
- [ ] Redis connection pool above 80% usage (scale concern)
- [ ] Session validation failures above 5% (security concern)

**Logging Requirements:**
- [ ] Cache operations (set/get/delete) with user ID and timestamp
- [ ] Session validation failures with reason codes
- [ ] Cache cleanup operations with statistics
- [ ] Fallback activations (Redis → URL params)
- [ ] Error conditions with stack traces

**Rollback Procedures:**
- [ ] Feature flag to disable role state persistence
- [ ] Cache flush procedure for corrupted data
- [ ] Redis cache namespace isolation for safe cleanup
- [ ] Redux state reset procedure for emergency cases

**Technical Considerations:**
- **Leverage existing Redis patterns** from gamification system
- **Extend proven RapidAPI cache manager** instead of new persistence
- **Use existing session management** for user-specific state
- **Simple URL-based fallback** for basic persistence
- **No localStorage complexity** or client-side persistence issues

**Performance Considerations:**
- Uses existing proven cache performance patterns
- No additional client-side storage or rehydration overhead
- Leverages existing Redis connection pooling and management
- Consistent with current application performance characteristics

**Risk Assessment & Mitigation:**

**High-Risk Areas Identified:**
1. **Redis Connection Pool Exhaustion**
   - Risk: Adding role state caching could overwhelm Redis connection pool
   - Mitigation: Use existing Redis instance with connection pooling limits
   - Monitoring: Track connection usage in existing Redis metrics

2. **Memory Leak in Client Cache**
   - Risk: Map-based cache could grow indefinitely with user sessions
   - Mitigation: Implement strict cache size limits (50 users max) and automatic cleanup
   - Monitoring: Memory usage tracking in cache manager

3. **Session Validation Complexity**
   - Risk: Complex session validation could create security vulnerabilities
   - Mitigation: Use existing NextAuth session patterns, simple token validation
   - Monitoring: Failed session validation alerts

4. **Cache Key Collisions**
   - Risk: Multiple users could have cache key conflicts
   - Mitigation: Use hashed userId + sessionId for unique keys
   - Monitoring: Cache key collision detection in metrics

5. **Redux State Synchronization**
   - Risk: Client cache and Redux state could become out of sync
   - Mitigation: Single source of truth pattern, middleware handles sync
   - Monitoring: State consistency validation in development

**Low-Risk Areas (Proven Patterns):**
- ✅ Redis caching patterns (already working in gamification)
- ✅ RapidAPI cache manager extension (proven architecture)
- ✅ NextAuth session management (existing integration)
- ✅ URL parameter handling (Next.js standard patterns)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: If Redis fails, immediately fallback to URL params
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Each fallback layer is simpler than the previous
3. **Monitoring & Alerting**: Track cache hit rates, memory usage, connection health
4. **Incremental Rollout**: Deploy to small user group first, monitor metrics
5. **Rollback Plan**: Can disable feature flag and revert to stateless behavior

**Estimated Timeline:** 1 week total (vs 2-3 weeks for Redux Persist)
**Risk Level:** Low-Medium - Uses proven patterns with careful risk mitigation
**Complexity:** Low - Extends existing architecture rather than adding new layers
