# üîß Test Suite Maintenance Checklist

**Updated**: August 7, 2025 (POST-CLEANUP)  
**Purpose**: Ongoing test health monitoring and maintenance procedures for TechRec platform  
**Owner**: Development Team (Tech Lead oversight)

**üö® CRITICAL**: Read the comprehensive E2E testing best practices:  
**üìñ See: [`./e2e-best-practices.md`](./e2e-best-practices.md)**

---

## üìÖ **MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE (Updated Post-Cleanup)**

### **Daily** (During Active Development)
- [ ] Run authentication tests before committing changes (`@test-auth`)
- [ ] MANDATORY: All new tests must authenticate first using `AuthHelper.ensureLoggedIn()`
- [ ] MANDATORY: CV-related tests must handle existing user data gracefully
- [ ] Monitor test execution time (clean suite: ~1 minute)

### **Weekly** (Development Team) 
- [ ] Run cleaned test suite (`@test-all`) - Should maintain 91% success rate
- [ ] Review any test failures and fix immediately (should be minimal now)
- [ ] Update [Test Health Report](./test-health-report.md) if success rate drops below 90%
- [ ] NO complex workflow or API-dependent tests allowed

### **Monthly** (Tech Lead)
- [ ] Comprehensive test health assessment
- [ ] Review and update test documentation
- [ ] Evaluate test value and remove low-value tests
- [ ] Plan test infrastructure improvements
- [ ] Update team on test metrics and goals

### **Quarterly** (Team Retrospective)
- [ ] Full test strategy review
- [ ] Test tool and framework evaluation
- [ ] Update testing best practices
- [ ] Assess team test training needs
- [ ] Review test coverage gaps

## üè• **HEALTH CHECK PROCEDURES**

### **Unit Test Health Check**
```bash
# Quick health check commands
npm run test | tail -10

# Look for these indicators:
# ‚úÖ All test suites passing
# ‚úÖ Execution time < 5 seconds  
# ‚úÖ No flaky test behavior
# ‚úÖ Clear test output
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 100% unit test pass rate
- [ ] Execution time < 5 seconds
- [ ] Zero flaky tests
- [ ] All new features have unit test coverage

### **Integration Test Health Check**
```bash
# Run integration test subset
npm run test -- --testPathPattern=".*DataFlow.*|.*Integration.*"

# Check specific critical tests
npm run test -- --testPathPattern="experienceDataFlow.test.ts"
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 100% integration test pass rate
- [ ] Data flow integrity maintained
- [ ] API contract tests passing
- [ ] Schema validation working

### **E2E Test Health Check**
```bash
# Ensure dev server is running first
curl -s http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null && echo "‚úÖ Server Ready" || echo "‚ùå Start Server"

# Run E2E tests
npx playwright test --reporter=list | tail -10

# Run only working tests for quick check
npx playwright test tests/e2e/core-workflows/user-authentication.spec.ts
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] > 80% E2E test pass rate
- [ ] Critical user journeys working
- [ ] Authentication flows stable
- [ ] No import/module errors

## üìä **TEST VALUE ASSESSMENT**

### **Quarterly Test Review Process**

#### **Step 1: Categorize Tests by Value**
Review all test files and categorize:

**‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê HIGH VALUE (Keep & Maintain)**
- Tests critical business logic
- Catches real bugs frequently  
- Fast execution
- Clear purpose and value

**‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê MEDIUM VALUE (Evaluate)**
- Tests important but not critical functionality
- Some overlap with other tests
- Occasionally catches bugs
- May need simplification

**‚≠ê LOW VALUE (Consider Removal)**
- Tests implementation details
- Never catches bugs
- Slow execution
- Duplicate coverage

#### **Step 2: Apply Value Criteria**
For each test category, ask:
- [ ] Does this test catch real bugs?
- [ ] Would removing it reduce confidence?
- [ ] Is execution time reasonable?
- [ ] Is it testing the right abstraction level?
- [ ] Does it overlap with other tests?

#### **Step 3: Take Action**
Based on assessment:
- **High Value**: Maintain and improve
- **Medium Value**: Simplify or convert to unit tests
- **Low Value**: Remove or mark as skip

## üõ†Ô∏è **COMMON MAINTENANCE TASKS**

### **Fixing Flaky Tests**
When tests pass/fail intermittently:

```bash
# Run test multiple times to confirm flakiness
for i in {1..10}; do npm run test -- --testPathPattern="flaky-test.test.ts"; done
```

**Common Fixes**:
- [ ] Add proper wait conditions
- [ ] Clean up test state between runs
- [ ] Fix race conditions in async operations
- [ ] Improve test isolation

### **Updating Test Data**
When business logic changes:
- [ ] Update mock data to reflect new requirements
- [ ] Verify test assertions match new behavior
- [ ] Update integration test contracts
- [ ] Refresh E2E test scenarios

### **Performance Optimization**
When tests become slow:
- [ ] Profile test execution time
- [ ] Optimize expensive operations
- [ ] Improve test parallelization
- [ ] Consider converting E2E to integration tests

### **Documentation Updates**
When tests change:
- [ ] Update [Test Health Report](./test-health-report.md)
- [ ] Update relevant guideline documents
- [ ] Update test command references
- [ ] Update team knowledge base

## üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Test Suite Suddenly Failing**
1. [ ] Check if dev server is running (for E2E tests)
2. [ ] Verify no recent dependency updates broke compatibility
3. [ ] Check for environment variable changes
4. [ ] Review recent code changes that might affect tests
5. [ ] Run tests individually to isolate the issue

### **New Feature Breaks Existing Tests**
1. [ ] Identify which tests are affected
2. [ ] Determine if tests need updating or if there's a regression
3. [ ] Update test expectations if business logic changed
4. [ ] Add new tests for the new feature
5. [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no other impacts

### **E2E Tests Becoming Unstable**
1. [ ] Check authentication setup
2. [ ] Verify element selectors are still valid
3. [ ] Increase timeouts for slow operations
4. [ ] Review test data setup and cleanup
5. [ ] Consider simplifying complex test scenarios

### **CI/CD Pipeline Test Failures**
1. [ ] Compare CI environment to local development
2. [ ] Check for timing differences in CI
3. [ ] Verify all necessary services are available in CI
4. [ ] Review CI-specific configuration
5. [ ] Add more robust error handling and retries
