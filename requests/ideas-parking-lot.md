## ðŸ’¡ How to Add New Ideas

1. **Brainstorm Freely**: Add any concept or improvement idea to the "Raw Concepts" section above
2. **No Filtering**: Don't worry about feasibility or priority at this stage
3. **Brief Description**: One line is enough - details come later in formal feature requests
4. **Natural Evolution**: Ideas that gain traction will be moved to formal feature requests

## ðŸš€ From Idea to Feature Request

When an idea is ready for formal planning:

1. **Create Feature Request**: Use the [Feature Request Template](./templates/feature-request-template.md)
2. **Move to Active**: Add to [Active Feature Requests](./index.md#active-feature-requests)
3. **Update Parking Lot**: Mark idea as moved with link to new feature request
4. **Begin Planning**: Start detailed technical and user experience planning
