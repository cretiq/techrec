## 💭 Active Feature Requests

### Feature Request #28: AI-Powered Job Description Scraping for Enhanced Content Generation

**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High
**Risk Level:** Medium (Mitigated by using a third-party API)

**Goal:** To dramatically improve the quality and relevance of AI-generated content, such as cover letters, by dynamically scraping and incorporating the full "About the job" section from LinkedIn job postings into the generation prompt.

**User Story:** As a developer using the Writing Help feature, when I generate a cover letter for a role that has a LinkedIn job posting link, I want the AI to automatically read the full job description from that link. This way, the generated content can be highly tailored, incorporating key details, responsibilities, and qualifications from the "About the job" section, making my application significantly more compelling and relevant.

**Success Metrics:**
- Generated cover letters for roles with LinkedIn links show a measurable increase in keyword overlap with the original job description.
- User acceptance rate of generated cover letters increases by 25% for roles with scraped content.
- The system successfully scrapes content from 95%+ of valid LinkedIn job posting URLs via the third-party API.
- End-to-end generation time, including scraping, remains under a reasonable threshold (e.g., 15 seconds) to maintain a good user experience.

**Technical Implementation Plan (Revised):**

1.  **Third-Party Scraping Service Integration:**
    -   A new utility (`utils/scrapers/jobScraper.ts`) will be created to abstract the third-party scraping API (e.g., BrightData, ScrapingBee).
    -   This service will handle making requests to the external API, passing the job posting URL, and processing the returned HTML.
    -   It will use `cheerio` to parse the HTML and extract the relevant job description text.
    -   The service will include robust error handling and return `null` if scraping fails, allowing the generation process to continue gracefully.

2.  **API Layer Modification & Caching:**
    -   The primary content generation API (`/api/generate-cover-letter`) will be modified.
    -   It will check if the `SavedRole` object contains a `jobPostingUrl`.
    -   **Redis Caching:** Before making a scraping request, the API will check Redis for a cached version of the job description (using the URL as the key). If found, it will use the cached data.
    -   If not cached, it will call the new `jobScraper` service. The successfully scraped content will be stored in Redis with a 1-hour TTL to reduce costs and latency.

3.  **AI Prompt Engineering:**
    -   The scraped job description text will be sanitized and injected into a new section of the AI prompt (e.g., `CONTEXT_FROM_JOB_POSTING: "{scraped_text}"`).
    -   The system prompt will be updated to explicitly instruct the AI to prioritize the scraped content.

4.  **Environment Configuration:**
    -   A new environment variable, `SCRAPING_API_KEY`, will be added to store the API key for the third-party service.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] A new `jobScraper.ts` utility is created to integrate with a third-party scraping API.
- [ ] The `/api/generate-cover-letter` endpoint is modified to include the web scraping step for `jobPostingUrl` found in `SavedRole` data.
- [ ] Scraped content is cached in Redis for 1 hour to optimize performance and cost.
- [ ] The AI prompt for cover letters is enhanced to include the scraped content, with instructions to use it.
- [ ] Generated cover letters for applicable roles reflect the specific details and language of the job description.
- [ ] The system gracefully handles failures in the scraping process by proceeding without the extra context.
- [ ] The UI provides clear feedback to the user that the job description is being analyzed (e.g., "Analyzing job description...").
- [ ] The `SCRAPING_API_KEY` is added to the environment configuration.

**Questions Resolved:**
- [x] **Scraping Technology**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Will use a reliable third-party scraping API to mitigate technical and legal risks.
- [x] **Latency Handling**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Latency will be managed via Redis caching and informative frontend loading states.
- [x] **Resilience**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - The scraper utility will be designed to be resilient to layout changes (handled by the third party) and the API will have graceful fallbacks.
- [x] **Scope**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - The feature will be available to all users for roles with a valid LinkedIn URL. Non-LinkedIn URLs will be ignored for now.

**Dependencies:**
- [x] A third-party web scraping service subscription and API key.
- [ ] Modifications to the `/api/generate-cover-letter` API route.
- [ ] Updates to the frontend loading indicators in `app/developer/writing-help/page.tsx`.
- [x] Redis for caching scraped content.



### Feature Request #23: AI-Powered Project Portfolio Enhancement System

**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Risk Level:** Medium (Simplified architecture with Redis caching and existing points system)

**Goal:** Create an intelligent project portfolio enhancement system that detects developers with limited project portfolios during CV analysis and provides AI-powered assistance to help them create exceptional CV sections and presentations for their personal projects, using a points-based gamification system to encourage quality portfolio development.

**User Story:** As a developer with limited portfolio projects, when I use the "Get AI suggestions" feature and the system detects insufficient project descriptions or limited GitHub activity, I want to see an intelligent suggestion to enhance my project portfolio so that I can improve descriptions of my existing public GitHub projects to create compelling CV sections and help me stand out to employers.

**Success Metrics (Revised for Realistic Expectations):**

- 95%+ of developers with limited project portfolios see enhancement suggestions (portfolio detection must be reliable)
- 40%+ engagement rate with the project enhancement feature (realistic for new complex feature)
- Average of 1+ projects enhanced per user session (quality over quantity)
- 70%+ of generated project descriptions are accepted by users (allowing for AI imperfection)
- Measurable improvement in total CV scores after project enhancements (+10-15 point average improvement)
- 30%+ of users complete the full enhancement flow (accounting for complexity)
- Reduced time-to-compelling-CV for developers with weak portfolios by 50% (conservative estimate)

**Critical Performance Metrics:**
- Portfolio assessment response time: <500ms (Redis cached results)
- AI generation success rate: >90% with proper fallbacks
- GitHub API availability: >95% with circuit breaker protection
- Feature uptime: >99.5% excluding external service dependencies
- Points deduction accuracy: 100% proper charging through existing system

**Priority:** High
**Dependency:** None (Standalone system)

**Goal:** Create an AI-powered project ideas generation system that guides developers through an intelligent questionnaire with brainstorming prompts, generates 2-3 personalized project suggestions, and provides detailed project planning when a specific idea is selected.

**User Story:** As a developer looking for project ideas, when I click "Get new project ideas" I want to go through a questionnaire with helpful brainstorming prompts and pill suggestions, then receive 2-3 project ideas with difficulty levels and recommended tech stacks, so that I can select one and get a detailed project plan to start building.

**Success Metrics:**

- 85%+ of users complete the questionnaire with brainstorming prompts
- 90%+ of users select at least one project card from generated suggestions
- AI generates exactly 2-3 relevant project ideas per session
- 75%+ of users proceed to view detailed project plan after card selection
- Average time from "Get new project ideas" to project selection: <5 minutes
- Generated projects include appropriate difficulty levels and tech stack recommendations

#### Technical Architecture

**Enhanced Questionnaire Flow Design with State Management:**

1. **Smart Questionnaire with Brainstorming Support & Auto-Save**
   - **Question**: "Do you have any problem in your everyday life that could be solved with software?"
   - **UI Pattern**: Text input (optional) + Brainstorming pill buttons below
   - **Pill Examples**: "Organize my schedule", "Track my expenses", "Find nearby services", "Learn new skills", "Stay in touch with friends"
   - **User Experience**: Users can type custom answers OR click pills for instant suggestions
   - **State Management**: Auto-save every 30 seconds, session recovery on page refresh
   - **Input Resolution**: Clear hierarchy - custom text overrides pills, combined when both present

2. **Additional Context Questions (Each with Pills & State Management)**
   - **Project Scope**: "How much time can you dedicate?"
     - Pills: "Weekend project", "1-2 weeks", "1 month", "2+ months"
     - Validation: At least one option must be selected or custom text provided
   - **Learning Goals**: "What would you like to learn/improve?"
     - Pills: "New framework", "Backend skills", "Mobile development", "UI/UX design", "Database management"
     - Multi-select: Users can select multiple pills or add custom goals
   - **Target Users**: "Who would use this app?"
     - Pills: "Just me", "Friends/family", "General public", "Small businesses", "Developers"
     - Single-select: One primary audience with option for custom text
   - **Platform Preference**: "What type of app interests you?"
     - Pills: "Web app", "Mobile app", "Desktop app", "API/Backend", "Chrome extension"
     - Single-select: One platform focus with technical rationale

3. **AI Generation Workflow with Robust Error Handling**
   - **Input Validation**: Verify questionnaire completeness, validate CV skills data availability
   - **Input Processing**: Resolve pills vs text conflicts, combine multi-select responses
   - **Process**: Fill validated prompt template → Gemini AI with circuit breaker → Generate exactly 2-3 project suggestions
   - **Output Validation**: JSON schema validation, fallback generation if response malformed
   - **Fallback Strategy**: Template-based project generation if AI fails, quality scoring for outputs

4. **Project Selection & Detailed Planning Architecture**
   - **Card Display**: Title, difficulty level, recommended skills/tools, time estimate
   - **Card Selection**: Click card → Navigate to `/developer/projects/plan/[sessionId]/[projectId]`
   - **Detailed Plan Page**: Dedicated route with comprehensive project planning
   - **Plan Content**: Generated project breakdown, development phases, setup instructions, resource links
   - **Plan Generation**: Separate AI call to generate detailed implementation guidance
   - **Session Persistence**: Store selected project and plan data in database and session storage
   - **Navigation State**: Breadcrumb navigation back to project cards, option to start new session

**AI Prompt Engineering:**

### Feature Request #25: Conditional Navigation Based on Authentication Status

**Status:** Planning Phase
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** Improve user experience and navigation clarity by hiding developer-specific navigation links when users are not authenticated, only showing relevant navigation options for unauthenticated visitors.

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated visitor to TechRec, when I view the site header navigation, I want to see only relevant navigation options (like login/signup) rather than developer-specific links I cannot access, so that the interface is clear and I'm not confused by links that require authentication.

**Success Metrics:**

- Clear navigation experience for unauthenticated users
- Elimination of confusing developer-specific links for visitors
- Maintained full navigation functionality for authenticated users
- Zero impact on existing authenticated user workflows
- Improved conversion rate for signup by reducing confusion

**Technical Approach:**

**Current Navigation Analysis:**
```tsx
// Currently visible to all users regardless of authentication:
- Home (links to "/developer/dashboard") 
- Dashboard (links to "/developer/dashboard")
- Features dropdown:
  - CV Management ("/developer/cv-management")
  - Role Search ("/developer/roles/search")
  - Saved Roles ("/developer/saved-roles")
```

**Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Conditional Navigation Rendering**
   - Wrap developer-specific navigation in conditional rendering based on `session` state
   - Use existing `useSession` hook from NextAuth for authentication status
   - Maintain existing component structure with minimal changes

2. **Navigation Link Classification**
   - **Always Visible**: Logo, Login/Signup buttons, theme toggles
   - **Authenticated Only**: Home, Dashboard, Features dropdown with developer routes
   - **Future Consideration**: Public pages (about, pricing, etc.) if needed

3. **Enhanced UX for Unauthenticated Users**
   - Keep clean, minimal navigation focused on conversion
   - Emphasize signup/login call-to-action
   - Remove cognitive load from irrelevant navigation options

**Code Changes Required:**

```tsx
// In components/client-layout.tsx - SessionAwareLayout component
// Wrap developer navigation in session check:

{session && (
  <nav className="hidden md:flex items-center gap-6" data-testid="nav-desktop-menu">
    <Link href="/developer/dashboard" className="text-sm font-medium text-base-content/80 hover:text-violet-600 transition-colors">
      Home
    </Link>
    <Link href="/developer/dashboard" className="text-sm font-medium text-base-content/80 hover:text-violet-600 transition-colors">
      Dashboard
    </Link>
    <div className="relative group" data-testid="nav-desktop-dropdown-features">
      {/* Features dropdown content */}
    </div>
  </nav>
)}
```

**Mobile Navigation Considerations:**
- Apply same conditional logic to mobile navigation menu
- Ensure mobile menu button only appears when there's content to show
- Maintain responsive design patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] **Unauthenticated Navigation**: When user is not logged in, navigation shows only logo, login, and signup options
- [ ] **Authenticated Navigation**: When user is logged in, full navigation (Home, Dashboard, Features) appears as before
- [ ] **Session State Integration**: Uses existing `useSession` hook for authentication state detection
- [ ] **Mobile Responsive**: Conditional navigation works correctly on all device sizes
- [ ] **No Functional Regression**: All existing authenticated user navigation remains unchanged
- [ ] **Clean Unauthenticated UI**: Unauthenticated navigation is clean and focused on conversion
- [ ] **Consistent Styling**: All navigation elements maintain existing DaisyUI styling and themes
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Updated data-testid attributes work correctly for both authenticated and unauthenticated states
- [ ] **Performance**: No performance impact from conditional rendering logic
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Navigation remains accessible with proper ARIA labels in both states

**Design Considerations:**

- **Unauthenticated State**: Simple, clean navigation emphasizing signup conversion
- **Authenticated State**: Full developer navigation as currently implemented
- **Transition Smoothness**: Seamless navigation changes during login/logout
- **Visual Consistency**: Maintain brand styling and theme integration

**Questions to Resolve:**

- [ ] Should we add any public navigation links for unauthenticated users (About, Pricing, etc.)?
- [ ] Do we need any intermediate navigation states during authentication loading?
- [ ] Should mobile menu button be hidden when no authenticated navigation is available?
- [ ] Any specific analytics tracking needed for navigation visibility states?

**Dependencies:**

- [ ] **Existing Authentication**: Leverages current NextAuth `useSession` implementation
- [ ] **Component Structure**: Minimal changes to existing `client-layout.tsx` structure
- [ ] **Styling System**: Uses existing DaisyUI classes and theme system
- [ ] **Test Infrastructure**: Updates existing data-testid patterns for testing
- [ ] **Session Management**: No changes needed to authentication logic

### Feature Request #11: Post-Signup Success Message on Sign-In Page

**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** To provide clear feedback to a user after they have successfully created an account, informing them that their account is ready and they can now sign in.

**User Story:** As a new user, after I complete the sign-up process, I want to see a confirmation message on the sign-in page so that I know my account was created successfully and I can proceed to log in.

**Success Metrics:**

- Reduced user confusion after sign-up.
- A clear visual indicator is present on the sign-in page for users who have just signed up.
- Increase in successful first-time logins after registration.

**Technical Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Backend (Sign-up API):** The registration API route (`/api/auth/register/route.ts`) will, upon successful account creation, redirect the user to the sign-in page with a success query parameter (e.g., `/auth/signin?signup=success`).
2.  **Frontend (Sign-in Page):** The sign-in page (`/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`) will read the query parameter from the URL.
3.  **UI Display:** If the `signup=success` parameter is present, render a subtle **Success** component (or `Alert` variant="success" if no dedicated component exists) **in place of** the default heading text. This component should replace the string "Welcome to TechRec\nSign in to access your dashboard" with a concise confirmation message and may include a close/dismiss action.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] On successful registration, the user is redirected to `/auth/signin?signup=success`.
- [ ] The sign-in page checks for the `signup=success` query parameter on load.
- [ ] If the parameter is present, render a subtle **Success** component (or `Alert` variant="success" if no dedicated component exists) **in place of** the default heading text. This component should replace the string "Welcome to TechRec\nSign in to access your dashboard" with a concise confirmation message and may include a close/dismiss action.
- [ ] The success component uses the existing success styling (Alert variant="success" or dedicated Success component).
- [ ] The default heading text ("Welcome to TechRec / Sign in to access your dashboard") is replaced by the success message component.
- [ ] The message does not appear on subsequent visits to the sign-in page (i.e., when the query parameter is not present).

**Questions to Resolve:**

**Questions Resolved:**

- [x] **Styling of success message**: ✅ Use existing *Success* component (or `Alert` variant="success") for styling.
- [x] **Dismissibility & placement**: ✅ Message should be subtle, replace the default heading text on the sign-in component, and can be dismissible.
- [x] **Multiple sign-in pages?** ✅ Only one sign-in page exists (`app/auth/signin/page.tsx`), so implementation targets that file.

**Dependencies:**

- [ ] Modification of `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` to include the redirect with a query parameter.
- [ ] Modification of `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` to handle the query parameter and display the message.
- [ ] An existing, styleable **Success** component (or `Alert` component with success variant) for displaying the message.

### Feature Request #16: GitHub-Style Application Activity Visualization Grid

**Status:** Partially Implemented (Backend Complete, Frontend Pending)
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** Create a GitHub-style contribution heatmap that visualizes job application activity over time, showing which days developers applied for jobs with color intensity indicating application volume.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a calendar heatmap (like GitHub's contribution graph) that shows my job application activity over the past 12 weeks, with each day colored based on how many applications I submitted. This will help me track my application consistency, identify productive periods, and maintain momentum in my job search.

**Success Metrics:**

- Clear visual representation of application frequency over time
- Easy identification of active vs inactive application periods  
- Motivational element encouraging consistent application activity
- Quick overview of application patterns and trends

**Technical Implementation Plan:**

    - **File**: `app/api/developer/application-activity/route.ts` (implement the `GET` handler).
    - **Query Parameters**: Fixed 12-week range from current date
    - **Response**: Array of `{ date: string, count: number }` objects for each day (84 days total)
    - **Data Source**: Aggregate application counts by date from "applied roles" tracking system

2.  **Frontend (Application Heatmap Component):**
    - Create a new component `ApplicationHeatmap.tsx`.
    - **Props**: `activityData: DailyActivity[]`
    - **Layout**: Calendar grid showing:
        - Days of week as rows (Sun-Sat) = 7 rows
        - 12 weeks as columns = 12 columns
        - Fixed 12x7 grid (84 total squares/days)
        - Each cell colored by application intensity (0-4+ applications)
        - Tooltip on hover showing date and application count
    - **Color Scale**: 
        - Light gray: 0 applications
        - Light green: 1 application  
        - Medium green: 2-3 applications
        - Dark green: 4+ applications
    - **Styling**: DaisyUI theme-aware colors, responsive to current page theme

3.  **Integration**:
    - Add `ApplicationHeatmap` to developer dashboard under the roadmap section
    - Include "Learn how we count applications" tooltip
    - Handle loading states and empty data gracefully
    - Responsive design for mobile devices

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Calendar heatmap displays exactly 12 weeks (84 days) of application activity
- [ ] Fixed 12x7 grid layout (12 weeks × 7 days)
- [ ] Each day cell shows correct color intensity based on application count
- [ ] Hover tooltips display date and exact application count
- [ ] Days with no applications show as light gray
- [ ] Color intensity scale: 0/1/2-3/4+ applications
- [ ] Colors are theme-sensitive using DaisyUI/Tailwind theme system
- [ ] Positioned under roadmap section in developer dashboard
- [ ] Historical data aggregated for one year of user activity
- [ ] Loading skeleton matches the final grid layout
- [ ] Empty state handled gracefully for new users
- [ ] "Learn how we count applications" informational element included

**Questions to Resolve:**

- [x] **Visualization Type**: ✅ Confirmed as GitHub-style contribution heatmap
- [x] **Time Range**: ✅ Static 12x7 grid (12 weeks, 84 days total)
- [x] **Application Counting**: ✅ Requires new "Mark as Applied" feature for role tracking
- [x] **Color Scale**: ✅ 0/1/2-3/4+ intensity levels, theme-sensitive with DaisyUI
- [x] **Dashboard Placement**: ✅ Under roadmap in developer dashboard
- [x] **Historical Data**: ✅ One year of aggregated data

✅ **Blocking Dependency Resolved**: "Mark as Applied" role tracking system completed ([Feature Request #17](#feature-request-17-"mark-as-applied"-role-tracking-system)). This feature now has the required application data source.

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ **Backend Infrastructure Complete**: API endpoint `/api/developer/application-activity` fully implemented with daily aggregation logic
- ✅ **Redux Integration Complete**: Application activity state management in `savedRolesSlice.ts` with proper data flow
- ⚠️ **Frontend Component Missing**: `ApplicationHeatmap.tsx` component needs to be created and integrated into dashboard

### Feature Request #19: Role Card Consistency Between Saved Roles and Search Results

**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** Ensure consistent role card appearance and functionality between saved roles and search results pages, including displaying the same information (like role match points) by potentially saving additional data when roles are saved.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the same type of role card with the same information (including role match points) whether I'm viewing my saved roles or searching for new opportunities, so that I have a consistent and seamless experience across different parts of the application.

**Success Metrics:**

- Identical role card layout and information between saved roles and search results
- Role match points displayed consistently in both contexts
- Same visual styling and interaction patterns
- Seamless user experience with no confusion about different card types

**Technical Implementation Plan:**

**Analysis Complete:** Current data discrepancies identified:
- **Missing Match Score**: Saved roles page lacks `MatchScoreCircle` component (key visual element)
- **Data Structure Gap**: Search results use full `Role` interface with rich data, saved roles use limited `InternalSavedRole` structure
- **Match Calculation**: Saved roles don't have access to role matching infrastructure

1.  **Component Architecture (Information + Action Split):**
    - **RoleCardInfo Component**: Unified information display for both contexts
      ```tsx
      interface RoleCardInfoProps {
        role: Role | SavedRole
        matchScore?: number
        showMatchScore?: boolean
        hasSkillsListed?: boolean
        matchingLoading?: boolean
      }
      ```
    - **RoleCardActions Component**: Context-specific action buttons
      ```tsx
      interface RoleCardActionsProps {
        context: 'search' | 'saved'
        actions: Array<'save' | 'apply' | 'markApplied' | 'remove' | 'writeTo'>
        isLoading?: boolean
      }
      ```
    - **Future-Proofing**: Separated architecture allows different action sets per context

2.  **Atomic Action Button System:**
    - **Individual Button Components**: Export each action button from separate files
      - `components/roles/actions/SaveRoleButton.tsx`
      - `components/roles/actions/ApplyButton.tsx`
      - `components/roles/actions/MarkAsAppliedButton.tsx` (already exists)
      - `components/roles/actions/RemoveRoleButton.tsx`
      - `components/roles/actions/WriteToButton.tsx`
    - **Composable Architecture**: Pull buttons into role cards as needed
    - **Consistent Props**: Standardized props interface across all action buttons

3.  **Data Enhancement for Saved Roles:**
    - **Enhanced Role Saving**: Capture full role data structure when saving
    - **Match Score Integration**: Add `MatchScoreCircle` to saved roles with recalculated scores
