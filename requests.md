### Feature Request #9: Comprehensive CV Data Persistence to Developer Database Profile

**Status:** Incomplete / Buggy
**Priority:** Critical

**Goal:** Fix the broken data persistence flow to ensure all extracted CV data is automatically and seamlessly saved to the developer's database profile, both on initial upload and when AI-driven suggestions are accepted.

**User Story (Revised):** As a developer, when I upload my CV or accept AI-generated improvements, I expect all my information (skills, experience, education, contact details, achievements) to be automatically and correctly saved to my profile in the background. This should happen seamlessly so I can immediately benefit from accurate role matching and profile completion without extra steps or manual data entry.

**Identified Bugs / Gaps:**

1.  **Initial Upload Sync Failure**: The background sync (`syncCvDataToProfile`) after a new CV is uploaded is failing silently. While the `CvAnalysis` record is created, the data is **not** propagated to the developer's main profile tables (`Experience`, `Education`, `DeveloperSkill`, etc.).
2.  **"AI Suggestions" Don't Persist**: When a user accepts AI suggestions on the CV analysis page, the changes are only reflected in the local Redux state. There is **no API call** to update the `CvAnalysis` record in the database or to trigger a profile sync with the new information.

**ðŸ”§ REVISED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:**

**Phase 1: Fix and Verify Background Sync Utility (1 day)**

**File: `utils/backgroundProfileSync.ts`**

- [ ] **Investigate & Fix**: Thoroughly debug the existing `syncCvDataToProfile` function. The logic likely fails during data transformation (e.g., incorrect date formats, enum mismatches, or invalid schema mapping). Add robust logging to pinpoint the exact failure point.
- [ ] **Data Transformation**: Ensure all CV analysis fields are correctly mapped to the `UpdateProfilePayloadSchema`. Pay close attention to nested objects, arrays, and date/enum conversions.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to log detailed error messages to the server console instead of failing silently. This is critical for future debugging.
- [ ] **Testing**: Create a standalone test script (`scripts/test-profile-sync.js`) to invoke this function with sample `CvAnalysis` data to verify it works reliably before integrating it back into the API routes.

**Phase 2: Implement "Accept AI Suggestions" Workflow (1.5 days)**

- [ ] **New API Endpoint**: Create a new endpoint: `PUT /api/cv-analysis/[id]`. This endpoint will accept a new `analysisResult` in its request body.
    - **File**: `app/api/cv-analysis/[id]/route.ts` (implement the `PUT` handler).
- [ ] **Backend Logic**:
    - The `PUT` handler must first validate the incoming data against the `UpdateCvAnalysisSchema`.
    - It will then update the corresponding `CvAnalysis` document in the database with the new `analysisResult`.
    - **Crucially**, after successfully updating the database, it must call the now-fixed `syncCvDataToProfile` function to ensure the developer's profile is updated with the new information.
- [ ] **Frontend Integration**:
    - In `components/analysis/AnalysisResultDisplay.tsx`, modify the `handleAcceptSuggestion` function.
    - When a user accepts a change, it should make a `PUT` request to the new `/api/cv-analysis/[id]` endpoint, sending the updated `analysisResult` object.
    - Upon a successful API response, it should update the local Redux state to reflect that the changes are now permanently saved.

**Phase 3: Re-integrate and Verify End-to-End Flow (1 day)**

- [ ] **CV Upload Routes**: Once `backgroundProfileSync.ts` is fixed and verified, re-test the full upload flow for both `/api/cv/upload/route.ts` and `/api/cv/upload-gemini/route.ts` to confirm the initial sync works as expected.
- [ ] **CV Analysis Update Route**: Verify that editing a CV analysis via the "Accept AI Suggestions" feature correctly updates the database and syncs the profile.
- [ ] **Remove Redundant Code**: The `save-version` route might become obsolete or need refactoring. Analyze if its functionality is covered by the new `PUT` endpoint and simplify if possible.

**âœ… REVISED ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**

- [ ] **Initial Upload Sync**: Uploading a new CV successfully populates the developer's `Experience`, `Education`, and `DeveloperSkill` tables in the database.
- [ ] **Accept Suggestions Persistence**: Accepting an AI suggestion on the CV analysis page triggers a `PUT` request, updates the `CvAnalysis` record, and syncs the changes to the developer's profile.
- [ ] **Data Integrity**: The developer's profile in the database accurately reflects the data from the latest version of their CV analysis.
- [ ] **Robust Error Logging**: Any failure in the background sync process is logged with detailed error messages on the server, but does **not** break the user-facing operation (like CV upload).
- [ ] **No User-Facing Changes**: The entire synchronization process remains invisible to the user.

### Feature Request #11: Post-Signup Success Message on Sign-In Page

**Status:** Planning Phase
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** To provide clear feedback to a user after they have successfully created an account, informing them that their account is ready and they can now sign in.

**User Story:** As a new user, after I complete the sign-up process, I want to see a confirmation message on the sign-in page so that I know my account was created successfully and I can proceed to log in.

**Success Metrics:**

- Reduced user confusion after sign-up.
- A clear visual indicator is present on the sign-in page for users who have just signed up.
- Increase in successful first-time logins after registration.

**Technical Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Backend (Sign-up API):** The registration API route (`/api/auth/register/route.ts`) will, upon successful account creation, redirect the user to the sign-in page with a success query parameter (e.g., `/auth/signin?signup=success`).
2.  **Frontend (Sign-in Page):** The sign-in page (`/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`) will read the query parameter from the URL.
3.  **UI Display:** If the `signup=success` parameter is present, a dismissible success alert will be rendered on the page, displaying the confirmation message.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] On successful registration, the user is redirected to `/auth/signin?signup=success`.
- [ ] The sign-in page checks for the `signup=success` query parameter on load.
- [ ] If the parameter is present, an alert component is displayed with the text: "Your account has been successfully created. You can now sign in with your email."
- [ ] The alert is styled with a success theme (e.g., green background/border).
- [ ] The message should be displayed prominently under the "Welcome to TechRec" heading.
- [ ] The message does not appear on subsequent visits to the sign-in page (i.e., when the query parameter is not present).

**Questions to Resolve:**

- [ ] What should be the exact styling of the success message? Should it use the existing `Alert` component?
- [ ] Should the success message be dismissible by the user? (Recommended: Yes, for a cleaner UI after they've read it).
- [ ] Are there different sign-in pages for different user types (e.g., developer vs. company) that need this logic, or does `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` handle all cases?

**Dependencies:**

- [ ] Modification of `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` to include the redirect with a query parameter.
- [ ] Modification of `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` to handle the query parameter and display the message.
- [ ] An existing, styleable `Alert` component for displaying the message.

### Feature Request #16: GitHub-Style Application Activity Visualization Grid

**Status:** Planning Phase
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** To provide a visual grid of application activity, similar to a GitHub commit history, that displays the user's recent job applications, their status, and key details in a compact, scrollable format.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a grid of my recent job applications with their status, company, role, date, and a quick action button to re-apply or view details. This will help me track my application history and identify patterns in my job search.

**Success Metrics:**

- Clear, organized grid layout for application history.
- Easy to scan and understand at a glance.
- Quick access to re-apply or view details.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.

**Technical Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Backend (Application History API):** Create a new endpoint `/api/applications/history` that returns a paginated list of applications.
    - **File**: `app/api/applications/history/route.ts` (implement the `GET` handler).
    - **Schema**: `ApplicationHistorySchema` (to be defined).
    - **Data**: Fetch applications from the database, including `applicationId`, `jobPostingId`, `companyName`, `roleTitle`, `status`, `appliedDate`, `easyApply`, `notes`, `coverLetterId`, `jobPostingUrl`.

2.  **Frontend (Application History Grid):**
    - Create a new component `ApplicationHistoryGrid.tsx`.
    - **Props**: `applications: ApplicationHistoryItem[]`, `onReapply: (applicationId: string) => void`, `onViewDetails: (applicationId: string) => void`.
    - **Layout**: Grid of cards, each displaying:
        - `companyName` (bold)
        - `roleTitle` (subtext)
        - `status` (badge)
        - `appliedDate` (subtext)
        - `easyApply` (boolean)
        - `notes` (truncated)
        - Quick action buttons: `Reapply` (if not applied), `View Details` (if applied).
    - **Styling**: Use DaisyUI cards, badges, and buttons.
    - **Responsive**: Stack cards on smaller screens.

3.  **Integration**:
    - Integrate `ApplicationHistoryGrid` into the developer dashboard.
    - Ensure it's only visible to authenticated users.
    - Handle loading and error states.
    - Maintain Redux state for selected applications.

- [ ] Status badges are clearly visible.
- [ ] Easy Apply status is easily identifiable.
- [ ] Notes are truncated and reveal on hover.
- [ ] Quick action buttons are prominent and functional.
- [ ] Responsive design works on all screen sizes.
- [ ] Loading and error states are handled gracefully.
- [ ] Grid is scrollable if applications exceed screen height.

**Questions to Resolve:**

- [ ] How many applications should be displayed in the grid? (e.g., 10-20).
- [ ] Should the grid be paginated? If so, how many items per page?
- [ ] How should the `Reapply` action be handled? Should it trigger a new cover letter generation?
- [ ] Should the `View Details` action navigate to the full application details page?
- [ ] How should the `Reapply` button be styled differently if the application is already applied?

**Dependencies:**

- [ ] New API endpoint `/api/applications/history`.
- [ ] New component `ApplicationHistoryGrid.tsx`.
- [ ] Integration into developer dashboard.
- [ ] Redux state management for selected applications.
