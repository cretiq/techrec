### Feature Request #9: Comprehensive CV Data Persistence to Developer Database Profile

**Status:** Incomplete / Buggy
**Priority:** Critical

**Goal:** Fix the broken data persistence flow to ensure all extracted CV data is automatically and seamlessly saved to the developer's database profile, both on initial upload and when AI-driven suggestions are accepted.

**User Story (Revised):** As a developer, when I upload my CV or accept AI-generated improvements, I expect all my information (skills, experience, education, contact details, achievements) to be automatically and correctly saved to my profile in the background. This should happen seamlessly so I can immediately benefit from accurate role matching and profile completion without extra steps or manual data entry.

**Identified Bugs / Gaps:**

1.  **Initial Upload Sync Failure**: The background sync (`syncCvDataToProfile`) after a new CV is uploaded is failing silently. While the `CvAnalysis` record is created, the data is **not** propagated to the developer's main profile tables (`Experience`, `Education`, `DeveloperSkill`, etc.).
2.  **"AI Suggestions" Don't Persist**: When a user accepts AI suggestions on the CV analysis page, the changes are only reflected in the local Redux state. There is **no API call** to update the `CvAnalysis` record in the database or to trigger a profile sync with the new information.

**🔧 REVISED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:**

**Phase 1: Fix and Verify Background Sync Utility (1 day)**

**File: `utils/backgroundProfileSync.ts`**

- [ ] **Investigate & Fix**: Thoroughly debug the existing `syncCvDataToProfile` function. The logic likely fails during data transformation (e.g., incorrect date formats, enum mismatches, or invalid schema mapping). Add robust logging to pinpoint the exact failure point.
- [ ] **Data Transformation**: Ensure all CV analysis fields are correctly mapped to the `UpdateProfilePayloadSchema`. Pay close attention to nested objects, arrays, and date/enum conversions.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to log detailed error messages to the server console instead of failing silently. This is critical for future debugging.
- [ ] **Testing**: Create a standalone test script (`scripts/test-profile-sync.js`) to invoke this function with sample `CvAnalysis` data to verify it works reliably before integrating it back into the API routes.

**Phase 2: Implement "Accept AI Suggestions" Workflow (1.5 days)**

- [ ] **New API Endpoint**: Create a new endpoint: `PUT /api/cv-analysis/[id]`. This endpoint will accept a new `analysisResult` in its request body.
    - **File**: `app/api/cv-analysis/[id]/route.ts` (implement the `PUT` handler).
- [ ] **Backend Logic**:
    - The `PUT` handler must first validate the incoming data against the `UpdateCvAnalysisSchema`.
    - It will then update the corresponding `CvAnalysis` document in the database with the new `analysisResult`.
    - **Crucially**, after successfully updating the database, it must call the now-fixed `syncCvDataToProfile` function to ensure the developer's profile is updated with the new information.
- [ ] **Frontend Integration**:
    - In `components/analysis/AnalysisResultDisplay.tsx`, modify the `handleAcceptSuggestion` function.
    - When a user accepts a change, it should make a `PUT` request to the new `/api/cv-analysis/[id]` endpoint, sending the updated `analysisResult` object.
    - Upon a successful API response, it should update the local Redux state to reflect that the changes are now permanently saved.

**Phase 3: Re-integrate and Verify End-to-End Flow (1 day)**

- [ ] **CV Upload Routes**: Once `backgroundProfileSync.ts` is fixed and verified, re-test the full upload flow for both `/api/cv/upload/route.ts` and `/api/cv/upload-gemini/route.ts` to confirm the initial sync works as expected.
- [ ] **CV Analysis Update Route**: Verify that editing a CV analysis via the "Accept AI Suggestions" feature correctly updates the database and syncs the profile.
- [ ] **Remove Redundant Code**: The `save-version` route might become obsolete or need refactoring. Analyze if its functionality is covered by the new `PUT` endpoint and simplify if possible.

**✅ REVISED ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**

- [ ] **Initial Upload Sync**: Uploading a new CV successfully populates the developer's `Experience`, `Education`, and `DeveloperSkill` tables in the database.
- [ ] **Accept Suggestions Persistence**: Accepting an AI suggestion on the CV analysis page triggers a `PUT` request, updates the `CvAnalysis` record, and syncs the changes to the developer's profile.
- [ ] **Data Integrity**: The developer's profile in the database accurately reflects the data from the latest version of their CV analysis.
- [ ] **Robust Error Logging**: Any failure in the background sync process is logged with detailed error messages on the server, but does **not** break the user-facing operation (like CV upload).
- [ ] **No User-Facing Changes**: The entire synchronization process remains invisible to the user.

### Feature Request #11: Post-Signup Success Message on Sign-In Page

**Status:** Planning Phase
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** To provide clear feedback to a user after they have successfully created an account, informing them that their account is ready and they can now sign in.

**User Story:** As a new user, after I complete the sign-up process, I want to see a confirmation message on the sign-in page so that I know my account was created successfully and I can proceed to log in.

**Success Metrics:**

- Reduced user confusion after sign-up.
- A clear visual indicator is present on the sign-in page for users who have just signed up.
- Increase in successful first-time logins after registration.

**Technical Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Backend (Sign-up API):** The registration API route (`/api/auth/register/route.ts`) will, upon successful account creation, redirect the user to the sign-in page with a success query parameter (e.g., `/auth/signin?signup=success`).
2.  **Frontend (Sign-in Page):** The sign-in page (`/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`) will read the query parameter from the URL.
3.  **UI Display:** If the `signup=success` parameter is present, a dismissible success alert will be rendered on the page, displaying the confirmation message.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] On successful registration, the user is redirected to `/auth/signin?signup=success`.
- [ ] The sign-in page checks for the `signup=success` query parameter on load.
- [ ] If the parameter is present, an alert component is displayed with the text: "Your account has been successfully created. You can now sign in with your email."
- [ ] The alert is styled with a success theme (e.g., green background/border).
- [ ] The message should be displayed prominently under the "Welcome to TechRec" heading.
- [ ] The message does not appear on subsequent visits to the sign-in page (i.e., when the query parameter is not present).

**Questions to Resolve:**

- [ ] What should be the exact styling of the success message? Should it use the existing `Alert` component?
- [ ] Should the success message be dismissible by the user? (Recommended: Yes, for a cleaner UI after they've read it).
- [ ] Are there different sign-in pages for different user types (e.g., developer vs. company) that need this logic, or does `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` handle all cases?

**Dependencies:**

- [ ] Modification of `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` to include the redirect with a query parameter.
- [ ] Modification of `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` to handle the query parameter and display the message.
- [ ] An existing, styleable `Alert` component for displaying the message.

### Feature Request #16: GitHub-Style Application Activity Visualization Grid

**Status:** Planning Phase (Blocked - Dependency Required)
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** Create a GitHub-style contribution heatmap that visualizes job application activity over time, showing which days developers applied for jobs with color intensity indicating application volume.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a calendar heatmap (like GitHub's contribution graph) that shows my job application activity over the past 12 weeks, with each day colored based on how many applications I submitted. This will help me track my application consistency, identify productive periods, and maintain momentum in my job search.

**Success Metrics:**

- Clear visual representation of application frequency over time
- Easy identification of active vs inactive application periods  
- Motivational element encouraging consistent application activity
- Quick overview of application patterns and trends

**Technical Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Backend (Application Activity API):** Create a new endpoint `/api/developer/application-activity` that returns daily application counts.
    - **File**: `app/api/developer/application-activity/route.ts` (implement the `GET` handler).
    - **Query Parameters**: Fixed 12-week range from current date
    - **Response**: Array of `{ date: string, count: number }` objects for each day (84 days total)
    - **Data Source**: Aggregate application counts by date from "applied roles" tracking system

2.  **Frontend (Application Heatmap Component):**
    - Create a new component `ApplicationHeatmap.tsx`.
    - **Props**: `activityData: DailyActivity[]`
    - **Layout**: Calendar grid showing:
        - Days of week as rows (Sun-Sat) = 7 rows
        - 12 weeks as columns = 12 columns
        - Fixed 12x7 grid (84 total squares/days)
        - Each cell colored by application intensity (0-4+ applications)
        - Tooltip on hover showing date and application count
    - **Color Scale**: 
        - Light gray: 0 applications
        - Light green: 1 application  
        - Medium green: 2-3 applications
        - Dark green: 4+ applications
    - **Styling**: DaisyUI theme-aware colors, responsive to current page theme

3.  **Integration**:
    - Add `ApplicationHeatmap` to developer dashboard under the roadmap section
    - Include "Learn how we count applications" tooltip
    - Handle loading states and empty data gracefully
    - Responsive design for mobile devices

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Calendar heatmap displays exactly 12 weeks (84 days) of application activity
- [ ] Fixed 12x7 grid layout (12 weeks × 7 days)
- [ ] Each day cell shows correct color intensity based on application count
- [ ] Hover tooltips display date and exact application count
- [ ] Days with no applications show as light gray
- [ ] Color intensity scale: 0/1/2-3/4+ applications
- [ ] Colors are theme-sensitive using DaisyUI/Tailwind theme system
- [ ] Positioned under roadmap section in developer dashboard
- [ ] Historical data aggregated for one year of user activity
- [ ] Loading skeleton matches the final grid layout
- [ ] Empty state handled gracefully for new users
- [ ] "Learn how we count applications" informational element included

**Questions to Resolve:**

- [x] **Visualization Type**: ✅ Confirmed as GitHub-style contribution heatmap
- [x] **Time Range**: ✅ Static 12x7 grid (12 weeks, 84 days total)
- [x] **Application Counting**: ✅ Requires new "Mark as Applied" feature for role tracking
- [x] **Color Scale**: ✅ 0/1/2-3/4+ intensity levels, theme-sensitive with DaisyUI
- [x] **Dashboard Placement**: ✅ Under roadmap in developer dashboard
- [x] **Historical Data**: ✅ One year of aggregated data

**Critical Dependency Identified:**

⚠️ **BLOCKING ISSUE**: This feature requires a **"Mark as Applied" feature** that doesn't currently exist. The user identified that there's no way to track when developers apply for roles, which is essential for the heatmap data.

**Required Prerequisite Feature:**
- **New Feature Request Needed**: "Mark as Applied" role tracking system
- **Scope**: Allow users to easily mark roles as "applied" and connect them to their developer account
- **Priority**: Must be completed before this heatmap feature can be implemented

**Dependencies:**

- [ ] **🚨 NEW FEATURE REQUIRED**: "Mark as Applied" role tracking system (blocking dependency)
- [ ] New API endpoint `/api/developer/application-activity`
- [ ] New component `ApplicationHeatmap.tsx` with calendar grid logic
- [ ] Integration into developer dashboard layout (under roadmap)
- [ ] Daily aggregation logic for application counts
- [ ] DaisyUI theme integration for color scheme

### Feature Request #18: Style-First Button System Refactoring

**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** Refactor the existing button system from feature-specific components to style-first, reusable button variants that prioritize visual consistency and maintainability, while keeping complex specialized buttons (e.g., TimerButton).

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use style-first buttons (e.g., PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton, BadgeButton) instead of most feature-specific buttons so that I can maintain consistent styling and easily reuse button styles across different features, while keeping specialized buttons for complex use cases.

**Success Metrics:**

- Reduced code duplication in button components
- Easier maintenance of button styles across the application
- More consistent visual hierarchy and button behavior
- Simplified button component architecture
- Better adherence to design system principles

**Current State Analysis:**

The existing `components/buttons.tsx` file contains feature-specific buttons like:
- `StartAssessmentButton`, `SubmitSolutionButton`, `SaveDraftButton`
- `CreateAssessmentButton`, `DeleteButton`, `MatchButton`, `WarningButton`, `ExportButton`, `ImportButton`
- **Keep specialized:** `TimerButton` (complex countdown functionality)

**Technical Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Style-First Button Components:**
    - Create reusable button variants based on visual style:
      - `PrimaryButton` - Main actions (solid, high emphasis)
      - `SecondaryButton` - Secondary actions (outline, medium emphasis)
      - `GhostButton` - Minimal actions (text-only, low emphasis)
      - `DestructiveButton` - Dangerous actions (red, warning emphasis)
      - `GlassButton` - Modern glass morphism style
      - `LinkedInButton` - LinkedIn branded style
      - `BadgeButton` - Flexible button that accepts badge icons/content as props
    - Each variant accepts common props: `loading`, `disabled`, `size`, `icon`, `children`, `className`

2.  **Enhanced Props Interface:**
    - **File**: `components/buttons.tsx` (selective refactoring)
    - **Props Interface**: 
      ```tsx
      interface ButtonProps {
        loading?: boolean
        disabled?: boolean
        size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl' | 'full'
        icon?: React.ReactNode
        onClick?: () => void
        className?: string // Allow custom Tailwind styling
        children: React.ReactNode
      }
      
      interface BadgeButtonProps extends ButtonProps {
        badge?: React.ReactNode // Badge icon or content
        badgePosition?: 'left' | 'right'
      }
      ```
    - **Usage Examples**:
      ```tsx
      <PrimaryButton icon={<Play />} loading={isSubmitting} size="full">
        Start Assessment
      </PrimaryButton>
      
      <BadgeButton badge={<CheckIcon />} className="w-full h-12">
        Complete Task
      </BadgeButton>
      
      <SecondaryButton size="lg" className="min-w-full">
        Custom Styled Button
      </SecondaryButton>
      ```

3.  **Selective Migration Strategy:**
    - Audit existing feature-specific button usage across the codebase
    - **Replace simple buttons** with appropriate style-first variants
    - **Keep specialized buttons** (TimerButton, other complex components)
    - Ensure all existing functionality (loading states, icons, etc.) is preserved
    - Update components importing from `buttons.tsx`

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Simple feature-specific buttons replaced with style-first variants (keep specialized ones like TimerButton)
- [ ] Consistent visual hierarchy across all button types
- [ ] All button variants support common props (loading, disabled, size, icon, className)
- [ ] Full-width and full-height sizing options (`size="full"` and custom className support)
- [ ] BadgeButton component for buttons with badge icons/content
- [ ] Custom styling support via className prop for Tailwind classes
- [ ] DaisyUI theme integration for color schemes
- [ ] Proper TypeScript interfaces for all button components
- [ ] Loading states, disabled states, and icon integration work consistently
- [ ] Reduced lines of code in `buttons.tsx` file (while keeping specialized buttons)
- [ ] No functionality lost during migration
- [ ] Updated button usage follows new style-first approach

**Implementation Decisions (Resolved):**

- ✅ **Complex buttons**: Keep specialized buttons like TimerButton that have complex functionality
- ✅ **Badge styling**: Create BadgeButton component that accepts badge icons/content as props
- ✅ **Icon positioning**: Support custom styling via className prop rather than built-in positioning
- ✅ **Size variants**: Support full parent width/height via `size="full"` and custom className
- ✅ **Component architecture**: Keep it simple - no compound components for now


**Dependencies:**

- [ ] Complete audit of existing button usage across the codebase
- [ ] DaisyUI theme integration for consistent styling
- [ ] TypeScript interface definitions for all button variants
- [ ] Selective migration of components using simple feature-specific buttons
- [ ] Testing to ensure no regression in button functionality
- [ ] BadgeButton component implementation with flexible badge prop system

### Feature Request #19: Role Card Consistency Between Saved Roles and Search Results

**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** Ensure consistent role card appearance and functionality between saved roles and search results pages, including displaying the same information (like role match points) by potentially saving additional data when roles are saved.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the same type of role card with the same information (including role match points) whether I'm viewing my saved roles or searching for new opportunities, so that I have a consistent and seamless experience across different parts of the application.

**Success Metrics:**

- Identical role card layout and information between saved roles and search results
- Role match points displayed consistently in both contexts
- Same visual styling and interaction patterns
- Seamless user experience with no confusion about different card types

**Technical Implementation Plan:**

**Analysis Complete:** Current data discrepancies identified:
- **Missing Match Score**: Saved roles page lacks `MatchScoreCircle` component (key visual element)
- **Data Structure Gap**: Search results use full `Role` interface with rich data, saved roles use limited `InternalSavedRole` structure
- **Match Calculation**: Saved roles don't have access to role matching infrastructure

1.  **Component Architecture (Information + Action Split):**
    - **RoleCardInfo Component**: Unified information display for both contexts
      ```tsx
      interface RoleCardInfoProps {
        role: Role | SavedRole
        matchScore?: number
        showMatchScore?: boolean
        hasSkillsListed?: boolean
        matchingLoading?: boolean
      }
      ```
    - **RoleCardActions Component**: Context-specific action buttons
      ```tsx
      interface RoleCardActionsProps {
        context: 'search' | 'saved'
        actions: Array<'save' | 'apply' | 'markApplied' | 'remove' | 'writeTo'>
        isLoading?: boolean
      }
      ```
    - **Future-Proofing**: Separated architecture allows different action sets per context

2.  **Atomic Action Button System:**
    - **Individual Button Components**: Export each action button from separate files
      - `components/roles/actions/SaveRoleButton.tsx`
      - `components/roles/actions/ApplyButton.tsx`
      - `components/roles/actions/MarkAsAppliedButton.tsx` (already exists)
      - `components/roles/actions/RemoveRoleButton.tsx`
      - `components/roles/actions/WriteToButton.tsx`
    - **Composable Architecture**: Pull buttons into role cards as needed
    - **Consistent Props**: Standardized props interface across all action buttons

3.  **Data Enhancement for Saved Roles:**
    - **Enhanced Role Saving**: Capture full role data structure when saving
    - **Match Score Integration**: Add `MatchScoreCircle` to saved roles with recalculated scores
    - **API Enhancement**: Update `/api/developer/saved-roles` to include complete role data
    - **Background Data Sync**: Ensure saved roles have access to match calculation data

4.  **Match Score Recalculation:**
    - **Real-time Calculation**: Recalculate match scores for saved roles on page load
    - **Performance Optimization**: Batch calculation for multiple saved roles
    - **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverage existing matching system from search results
    - **Consistent Display**: Same `MatchScoreCircle` component in both contexts

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] **RoleCardInfo component** displays identical information in both search and saved contexts
- [ ] **MatchScoreCircle component** appears on saved roles page with recalculated scores
- [ ] **Atomic action buttons** exported from separate files for maximum reusability
- [ ] **RoleCardActions component** handles context-specific action button combinations
- [ ] **Enhanced role saving** captures complete role data structure (not just basic fields)
- [ ] **Match score recalculation** works for saved roles using existing matching infrastructure
- [ ] **Performance optimized** with batch calculation for multiple saved roles
- [ ] **Future-proof architecture** allows different action sets per context
- [ ] **Consistent styling** using DaisyUI classes across both implementations
- [ ] **No regression** in existing functionality for either search or saved roles
- [ ] **API consistency** between search and saved roles endpoints for role data

**Questions to Resolve:**

- [x] **What specific additional data needs to be saved when a role is saved to ensure consistency?**
  ✅ **RESOLVED**: Analysis completed - Key missing element is `MatchScoreCircle` component and associated match calculation data. Full `Role` interface data structure needed instead of limited `InternalSavedRole`.

- [x] **Should role match points be recalculated periodically for saved roles or cached permanently?**
  ✅ **RESOLVED**: Recalculated. Match scores will be recalculated on page load for saved roles using existing matching infrastructure.

- [x] **Are there performance implications of calculating match scores for all saved roles?**
  ✅ **RESOLVED**: Performance impact negligible. Will implement batch calculation for optimization.

- [x] **Should the unified component handle all role-related actions or delegate to specialized components?**
  ✅ **RESOLVED**: Split into "information" and "action" sections. `RoleCardInfo` for data display (shared), `RoleCardActions` for context-specific actions (future-proofed).

- [x] **What's the best approach for handling different action buttons between search and saved contexts?**
  ✅ **RESOLVED**: Atomic button architecture. Export each action button from separate files for maximum reusability and composability.

**Dependencies:**

- [ ] **RoleCardInfo component** implementation for unified information display
- [ ] **RoleCardActions component** implementation for context-specific actions
- [ ] **Atomic action button files** creation in `components/roles/actions/`
- [ ] **Enhanced role saving API** to capture complete Role interface data
- [ ] **Match score integration** for saved roles using existing matching infrastructure
- [ ] **Batch calculation optimization** for multiple saved roles performance
- [ ] **API data consistency** between search and saved roles endpoints
- [ ] **MatchScoreCircle integration** into saved roles page layout
- [ ] **DaisyUI styling consistency** across both implementations
- [ ] **Background data sync** for saved roles to include match calculation data
