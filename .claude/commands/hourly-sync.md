Perform hourly session optimization and memory sync:

## Context Analysis & Memory Update
Think hard about analyzing current project state and updating memory:

### 1. PROJECT STATE ANALYSIS
- **Recent Changes**: Analyze git log, recent commits, and modified files since last session
- **Current Context**: Understand active branch, pending work, and immediate priorities
- **Codebase Evolution**: Identify new patterns, architectural changes, or dependency updates
- **Development Focus**: Recognize current feature work, bug fixes, or refactoring efforts

### 2. PATTERN RECOGNITION
- **Effective Collaboration**: What prompting styles and workflows worked well this session?
- **Quality Patterns**: Which coding approaches and standards proved most effective?
- **Problem-Solving Success**: What debugging or development strategies were particularly useful?
- **Tool Usage**: Which commands, shortcuts, or integrations enhanced productivity?

### 3. MEMORY OPTIMIZATION
Based on analysis, update ./CLAUDE.md with:
- **New Conventions**: Any coding standards or patterns that emerged
- **Architectural Insights**: Design decisions, patterns, or structural understanding
- **Workflow Improvements**: Effective development processes or collaboration methods
- **Context Enhancements**: Project-specific knowledge that improves future assistance

### 4. PREPARATION FOR CONTINUATION
- **Current State Summary**: Document where we are and what's actively being worked on
- **Next Session Setup**: Prepare context for seamless continuation
- **Priority Identification**: Note urgent items or blockers for immediate attention
- **Context Preservation**: Ensure all relevant information is captured for future sessions

Update our memory with actionable insights that will make future collaboration more effective. Focus on patterns, preferences, and project-specific knowledge that enhance development speed and quality.
