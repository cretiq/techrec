Analyze all changes and create logical commits for implemented features from DEVELOPMENT_BRAINSTORMING.md with excellent traceability:

## Feature Implementation Commit Strategy
This process is used AFTER implementing a feature request from DEVELOPMENT_BRAINSTORMING.md and BEFORE marking it as done. The goal is maximum traceability between your commits and the planned feature requests.

## Single Commit Per Feature Request Preference
**Default approach**: Create ONE comprehensive commit per feature request that includes all related changes. This provides:
- Clear feature boundaries and atomic implementation
- Simplified git history with direct feature traceability
- Complete feature context in a single commit
- Easier rollback and feature management

**Multiple commits only when necessary**: Split commits only for compelling technical reasons:
- **Breaking changes**: When feature requires database migrations or breaking API changes that should be separate
- **Large refactors**: When significant existing code restructuring is needed before feature implementation
- **Critical dependencies**: When foundational changes must be stable before building the feature
- **Review complexity**: When a single commit would be too large to review effectively (>50 files or major architectural changes)

## Comprehensive Change Analysis
Think hard about organizing commits to clearly show what feature request was implemented:

### 1. FEATURE REQUEST ALIGNMENT
First, identify which Feature Request from DEVELOPMENT_BRAINSTORMING.md was implemented:
- **Primary Feature Request**: The main feature request being implemented (e.g., "Feature Request #5: Cover Letter Application Routing")
- **Supporting Components**: Related components or dependencies that were needed
- **Feature Scope**: Which acceptance criteria and technical implementation details were completed

### 2. CHANGE CATEGORIZATION
Analyze all modified files and group changes by logical purpose within the feature context:
- **Core feature implementation**: Main functionality matching the feature request's technical approach
- **UI/UX components**: New components, styling, and user interface elements
- **Backend/API changes**: Server-side logic, database changes, API modifications  
- **Type definitions**: Interface updates, type extensions for the feature
- **Integration points**: Connections with existing systems or components
- **Tests**: Feature-specific tests, validation, and quality assurance
- **Documentation**: Feature documentation, code comments, implementation notes

### 3. COMMIT ORGANIZATION STRATEGY
**Primary approach - Single comprehensive commit**:
- **Feature-complete commit**: Include all changes that implement the feature request
- **Holistic implementation**: Types, backend, frontend, tests, and documentation together
- **Complete functionality**: Ensure the feature is fully working in the single commit
- **Atomic feature boundary**: All changes relate to the same feature request

**Alternative approach - Multiple commits (only when necessary)**:
- **Technical necessity**: Only when compelling technical reasons exist (see above)
- **Dependency order**: Foundation components first, then features that build on them
- **Logical progression**: Each commit should represent a complete, stable increment
- **Feature traceability**: All commits should reference the same feature request

### 4. COMMIT MESSAGE EXCELLENCE WITH FEATURE TRACEABILITY
For each commit, create messages that clearly reference the implemented feature request:

#### Format: `type(scope): description [FR #X]`

**Types** (prioritized for feature implementation):
- `feat`: New feature implementation (most common for feature requests)
- `refactor`: Code improvements supporting the feature
- `test`: Tests for the implemented feature
- `docs`: Documentation for the implemented feature
- `chore`: Dependencies, configuration, or setup for the feature
- `style`: Styling and UI changes for the feature
- `fix`: Bug fixes discovered during feature implementation

**Scope** (recommended - use feature context):
- Component or area related to the feature (e.g., `cover-letter`, `company-search`, `application-routing`)
- Use scope from the feature request's technical approach when possible

**Description**:
- Use imperative mood: "add", "implement", "create" (not "added", "implemented", "created")
- Reference the specific feature capability being added
- Start with lowercase letter, no period at the end
- Maximum 50 characters for the first line

**Feature Request Reference [FR #X]**:
- ALWAYS include the feature request number at the end: `[FR #5]`
- This creates clear traceability to DEVELOPMENT_BRAINSTORMING.md
- Enables easy cross-referencing between commits and planning documents

#### Extended Message Format:
```
type(scope): brief description [FR #X]

Feature implementation details (â‰¤72 chars per line):
- Implements [specific acceptance criteria from feature request]
- Technical approach: [brief summary of implementation method]
- Components: [key components/files modified]
- Integration: [how this connects with existing system]
- Testing: [validation and quality assurance included]

Relates to Feature Request #X in DEVELOPMENT_BRAINSTORMING.md
```

### 5. EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS
**For single commit (preferred approach)**:

1. **Stage all feature-related files**:
   ```bash
   git add [all files related to the feature request]
   ```

2. **Create comprehensive feature commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(scope): implement complete feature [FR #X]
   
   Feature implementation details:
   - Implements [all acceptance criteria]
   - Technical approach: [comprehensive implementation summary]
   - Components: [all files/components modified]
   - Integration: [complete system connections]
   - Testing: [all validation and quality assurance]
   
   Relates to Feature Request #X in DEVELOPMENT_BRAINSTORMING.md"
   ```

**For multiple commits (only when necessary)**:

1. **Stage specific files for each logical component**:
   ```bash
   git add [specific files for this feature component]
   ```

2. **Create feature-traceable commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(scope): implement feature component [FR #X]
   
   Feature implementation details:
   - Implements [specific acceptance criteria]
   - Technical approach: [brief implementation summary]
   - Components: [key files/components modified]
   - Integration: [how this connects with existing system]
   
   Relates to Feature Request #X in DEVELOPMENT_BRAINSTORMING.md"
   ```

3. **Verify feature alignment**:
   - Ensure commit aligns with feature request acceptance criteria
   - Check that commit message references the correct Feature Request #X
   - Confirm changes match the technical approach from the feature request
   - Verify no unrelated changes are included

### 6. QUALITY STANDARDS FOR FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION
Each commit must meet these criteria:
- **Feature-aligned**: Directly implements part of a planned feature request
- **Traceable**: References Feature Request #X for clear planning connection
- **Atomic**: Contains only changes belonging to this feature request
- **Complete**: Doesn't break the build or leave the feature incomplete
- **Descriptive**: Commit message clearly maps to acceptance criteria
- **Reviewable**: Changes can be understood in context of the feature request

### 7. EXAMPLES OF EXCELLENT FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION COMMITS

**Single Comprehensive Commit (Preferred)**:
```

```

### 8. COMMIT VERIFICATION & FEATURE ALIGNMENT
Before finalizing each commit:
- **Review staged changes**: Ensure only changes related to the specific feature request are included
- **Verify feature reference**: Confirm commit message includes correct [FR #X] reference
- **Test functionality**: Verify the commit doesn't break existing functionality or feature integration
- **Check acceptance criteria**: Ensure commit aligns with specific acceptance criteria from the feature request
- **Validate completeness**: Confirm commit represents complete feature implementation or logical component

### 9. WORKFLOW INTEGRATION
This commit process integrates with your feature development workflow:

#### Before Committing:
1. **Implement feature** following the technical approach from DEVELOPMENT_BRAINSTORMING.md
2. **Run this smart-commit process** to create traceable commits
3. **Verify all acceptance criteria** are implemented

#### After Committing:
1. **MOVE FEATURE TO COMPLETED SECTION** - This is mandatory:
   - Move the feature request from "Active Feature Requests" to "Recently Completed Features" section in DEVELOPMENT_BRAINSTORMING.md
   - Include completion date, impact assessment, key learnings, and implementation notes
   - Reference the commits created in the implementation notes
2. **UPDATE TABLE OF CONTENTS** - Required when changing document structure:
   - Update the TOC in DEVELOPMENT_BRAINSTORMING.md when moving features between sections
   - Add new entries for any new feature requests or sections created
   - Remove entries for any sections that were removed or renamed
   - Ensure all anchor links match the actual header names exactly
3. **Update cursor rule** to reflect new active feature count if needed

#### Required Post-Implementation Step:
**ðŸ”„ CRITICAL**: After creating commits for a feature request, you MUST move it from the "Active Feature Requests" section to the "Recently Completed Features" section in DEVELOPMENT_BRAINSTORMING.md. This maintains accurate project status and prevents confusion about which features are still in development.

#### Traceability Chain:
```
Feature Request #X (DEVELOPMENT_BRAINSTORMING.md - Active)
    â†“ (implementation)
Commits with [FR #X] reference (git history)
    â†“ (completion - REQUIRED STEP)
Recently Completed Features (DEVELOPMENT_BRAINSTORMING.md - Completed)
```

This creates a complete audit trail from planning â†’ implementation â†’ completion, making it easy to understand what was built, when, and why.

Focus on creating commits that clearly trace back to planned feature requests, enabling seamless project history navigation and feature lifecycle tracking. **Prefer single comprehensive commits per feature request** for cleaner git history and better feature boundaries.
