Analyze all changes and create logical commits with excellent commit messages for clear versioning:

## Comprehensive Change Analysis
Think hard about organizing commits for maximum clarity and maintainability:

### 1. CHANGE CATEGORIZATION
Analyze all modified files and group changes by logical purpose:
- **Feature additions**: New functionality, components, or capabilities
- **Bug fixes**: Error corrections, issue resolutions, or problem fixes
- **Refactoring**: Code improvements without functional changes
- **Documentation**: README updates, code comments, or API documentation
- **Configuration**: Build scripts, dependencies, environment setup
- **Tests**: New tests, test fixes, or test improvements
- **Style/formatting**: Code style, linting fixes, or formatting changes

### 2. LOGICAL CHUNKING STRATEGY
Group related changes into coherent commits:
- **Atomic changes**: Each commit should represent one logical unit of work
- **Dependencies**: Ensure dependent changes are in the same commit or proper order
- **Separation of concerns**: Keep different types of changes in separate commits
- **Reviewability**: Each commit should be independently reviewable and understandable

### 3. COMMIT MESSAGE EXCELLENCE
For each commit, create messages following this structure:

#### Format: `type(scope): description`

**Types** (use these exactly):
- `feat`: New feature or enhancement
- `fix`: Bug fix or error correction
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without functional change
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions or modifications
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependencies, configuration
- `style`: Code style, formatting, whitespace changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `security`: Security-related changes

**Scope** (optional but recommended):
- Component, module, or area affected (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`, `database`)

**Description**:
- Use imperative mood: "add", "fix", "update" (not "added", "fixed", "updated")
- Start with lowercase letter
- No period at the end
- Maximum 50 characters for the first line

#### Extended Message Format:
```
type(scope): brief description (≤50 chars)

Optional longer explanation of what and why (≤72 chars per line):
- What was changed
- Why it was changed  
- Any important context or implications
- Breaking changes (if any)
- Related issues or tickets

Co-authored-by: Name <email@example.com> (if applicable)
```

### 4. COMMIT SEQUENCE PLANNING
Plan the order of commits for logical progression:
- **Foundation first**: Core changes that other changes depend on
- **Features next**: New functionality built on the foundation
- **Tests and docs**: Validation and documentation for the changes
- **Polish last**: Style, formatting, and minor improvements

### 5. EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS
For each planned commit:

1. **Stage specific files**:
   ```bash
   git add [specific files for this logical unit]
   ```

2. **Create descriptive commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "type(scope): description
   
   Extended explanation if needed:
   - Key changes made
   - Rationale for the changes
   - Any important notes or implications"
   ```

3. **Verify commit quality**:
   - Ensure commit is atomic and logical
   - Check that commit message accurately describes changes
   - Confirm no unrelated changes are included

### 6. QUALITY STANDARDS
Each commit must meet these criteria:
- **Atomic**: Contains only related changes that belong together
- **Complete**: Doesn't break the build or leave the code in inconsistent state
- **Descriptive**: Commit message clearly explains what and why
- **Reviewable**: Changes can be understood and reviewed independently
- **Traceable**: Easy to understand the progression of changes

### 7. EXAMPLES OF EXCELLENT COMMITS

**Feature Addition**:
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration with Google

Implements Google OAuth2 authentication flow:
- Add OAuth2 configuration and environment variables
- Create authentication middleware and routes
- Integrate with existing user management system
- Add proper error handling and redirects

Closes #123
```

**Bug Fix**:
```
fix(api): resolve race condition in user registration

Fixes intermittent 500 errors during concurrent registrations:
- Add database transaction for atomic user creation
- Implement proper error handling for duplicate emails
- Add retry logic for transient database errors

Fixes #456
```

**Refactoring**:
```
refactor(components): extract reusable form validation logic

Consolidates duplicate validation code across forms:
- Create ValidationHelper utility class
- Update all form components to use shared validation
- Maintain existing behavior and API compatibility
- Improve test coverage for validation logic
```

### 8. COMMIT VERIFICATION
Before finalizing each commit:
- **Review staged changes**: Ensure only intended changes are included
- **Test functionality**: Verify the commit doesn't break existing functionality
- **Check message quality**: Ensure commit message is clear and follows conventions
- **Validate atomicity**: Confirm commit represents one logical unit of work

Create a series of well-structured commits that tell a clear story of the changes made, making future debugging, code review, and project history navigation as straightforward as possible.

Focus on creating commits that a developer could easily understand and work with months from now, even without additional context.
