# Intelligent Git Commit Command

This command analyzes the current working directory changes and creates logical, well-structured commits following best practices.

## Purpose
- Automatically stage and commit all changes in logical chunks
- Generate clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commit format
- Divide changes into appropriate commit sizes for better version control
- Follow the project's established commit patterns and conventions

## Usage
Simply reference this command: `@.claude/commands/commit`

## Behavior
1. **Analyze Changes**: Review all unstaged and staged changes
2. **Logical Grouping**: Group related changes together (features, fixes, refactoring, etc.)
3. **Commit Strategy**: Create multiple commits if changes span different concerns
4. **Message Format**: Use conventional commit format with proper scopes
5. **Verification**: Ensure commits are clean and properly documented

## Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body explaining why, not what]

[optional footer with breaking changes/closes issues]
